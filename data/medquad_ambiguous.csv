treatment,how is hps diagnosed and treated for Hantavirus ?,"Diagnosing HPS
  
Diagnosing HPS in an individual who has only been infected a few days is difficult, because early symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, and fatigue are easily confused with influenza. However, if the individual is experiencing fever and fatigue and has a history of potential rural rodent exposure, together with shortness of breath, would be strongly suggestive of HPS. If the individual is experiencing these symptoms they should see their physician immediately and mention their potential rodent exposure.
  Treating HPS
  
    
      
     
   
  
  
There is no specific treatment, cure, or vaccine for hantavirus infection. However, we do know that if infected individuals are recognized early and receive medical care in an intensive care unit, they may do better. In intensive care, patients are intubated and given oxygen therapy to help them through the period of severe respiratory distress.
  
The earlier the patient is brought in to intensive care, the better. If a patient is experiencing full distress, it is less likely the treatment will be effective.
  
Therefore, if you have been around rodents and have symptoms of fever, deep muscle aches, and severe shortness of breath, see your doctor immediately. Be sure to tell your doctor that you have been around rodents—this will alert your physician to look closely for any rodent-carried disease, such as HPS.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""hps"", ""full_form"": ""Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome""}]}",how is hps diagnosed and treated for Hantavirus ?,how is Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome diagnosed and treated for Hantavirus ?
information,What is (are) 3MC syndrome ?,"3MC syndrome is a disorder characterized by unusual facial features and problems affecting other tissues and organs of the body.  The distinctive facial features of people with 3MC syndrome include widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), highly arched eyebrows, and an opening in the upper lip (cleft lip) with an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Common features affecting other body systems include developmental delay, intellectual disability, hearing loss, and slow growth after birth resulting in short stature. Other features of 3MC syndrome can include abnormal fusion of certain bones in the skull (craniosynostosis) or forearm (radioulnar synostosis); an outgrowth of the tailbone (caudal appendage); a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia); and abnormalities of the kidneys, bladder, or genitals.  3MC syndrome encompasses four disorders that were formerly considered to be separate: Mingarelli, Malpeuch, Michels, and Carnevale syndromes.

prevention,How to prevent Parasites - Toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma infection) ?,"People who are healthy should follow the guidelines below to reduce risk of toxoplasmosis. If you have a weakened immune system, please see guidelines for Immunocompromised Persons.
   Reduce Risk from Food
   
To prevent risk of toxoplasmosis and other infections from food:
   
    - Freeze meat for several days at sub-zero (0° F) temperatures before cooking to greatly reduce chance of infection.
    - Peel or wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating. 
     
      
     
    - Wash cutting boards, dishes, counters, utensils, and hands with hot soapy water after contact with raw meat, poultry, seafood, or unwashed fruits or vegetables.
   
   
More on: Handwashing
   
The U.S. Government and the meat industry continue their efforts to reduce T. gondii in meat.
   Reduce Risk from the Environment
   
To prevent risk of toxoplasmosis from the environment:
   
    - Avoid drinking untreated drinking water.
    - Wear gloves when gardening and during any contact with soil or sand because it might be contaminated with cat feces that contain Toxoplasma. Wash hands with soap and warm water after gardening or contact with soil or sand.
    - Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection.
    - Keep outdoor sandboxes covered. 
     
      
     
    - Feed cats only canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table food, not raw or undercooked meats.
    - Change the litter box daily if you own a cat. The Toxoplasma parasite does not become infectious until 1 to 5 days after it is shed in a cat's feces. If you are pregnant or immunocompromised: 
     
      - Avoid changing cat litter if possible. If no one else can perform the task, wear disposable gloves and wash your hands with soap and warm water afterwards.
      - Keep cats indoors.
      - Do not adopt or handle stray cats, especially kittens.

                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Rituximab is a type of monoclonal antibody used to treat newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma in patients who do not have AIDS.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to Mabry syndrome ?,"Mutations in the PIGV, PIGO, or PGAP2 gene cause Mabry syndrome. These genes are all involved in the production (synthesis) of a molecule called a glycosylphosphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. This molecule is synthesized in a series of steps. It then attaches (binds) to various proteins and binds them to the outer surface of the cell membrane, ensuring that they are available when needed. Alkaline phosphatase is an example of a protein that is bound to the cell membrane by a GPI anchor.  The proteins produced from the PIGV and PIGO genes are involved in piecing together the GPI anchor. After the complete GPI anchor is attached to a protein, the protein produced from the PGAP2 gene adjusts the anchor to enhance the anchor's ability to bind to the cell membrane.  Mutations in the PIGV, PIGO, or PGAP2 gene result in the production of an incomplete GPI anchor that cannot attach to proteins or to cell membranes. Proteins lacking a functional GPI anchor cannot bind to the cell membrane and are instead released from the cell. The release of non-GPI anchored alkaline phosphatase elevates the amount of this protein in the blood, causing hyperphosphatasia in people with Mabry syndrome. It is unclear how gene mutations lead to the other features of Mabry syndrome, but these signs and symptoms are likely due to a lack of proper GPI anchoring of proteins.  PIGV gene mutations are the most frequent cause of Mabry syndrome, accounting for approximately half of all cases. Mutations in the PIGO and PGAP2 genes are responsible for a small proportion of Mabry syndrome. The remaining affected individuals do not have an identified mutation in any of these three genes; the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""Mabry syndrome"", ""full_form"": ""Mental retardation, autosomal recessive 29""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to Mabry syndrome ?,"What are the genetic changes related to Mental retardation, autosomal recessive 29 ?"

Symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia most often come from
                
- a blocked urethra  - a bladder that is overworked from trying to pass urine through the blockage
                
The size of the prostate does not always determine the severity of the blockage or symptoms.

A potential side effect of these medications may prevent the bladder neck from relaxing and releasing urine. Medications that contain antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, can weaken the contraction of bladder muscles and cause urinary retention, difficulty urinating, and painful urination.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to GM1 gangliosidosis ?,"Mutations in the GLB1 gene cause GM1 gangliosidosis. The GLB1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called beta-galactosidase (-galactosidase), which plays a critical role in the brain. This enzyme is located in lysosomes, which are compartments within cells that break down and recycle different types of molecules. Within lysosomes, -galactosidase helps break down several molecules, including a substance called GM1 ganglioside. GM1 ganglioside is important for normal functioning of nerve cells in the brain.  Mutations in the GLB1 gene reduce or eliminate the activity of -galactosidase. Without enough functional -galactosidase, GM1 ganglioside cannot be broken down when it is no longer needed. As a result, this substance accumulates to toxic levels in many tissues and organs, particularly in the brain. Progressive damage caused by the buildup of GM1 ganglioside leads to the destruction of nerve cells in the brain, causing many of the signs and symptoms of GM1 gangliosidosis. In general, the severity of GM1 gangliosidosis is related to the level of -galactosidase activity. Individuals with higher enzyme activity levels usually have milder signs and symptoms than those with lower activity levels because they have less accumulation of GM1 ganglioside within the body.  Conditions such as GM1 gangliosidosis that cause molecules to build up inside the lysosomes are called lysosomal storage disorders.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""GM1"", ""full_form"": ""GM1 gangliosidosis""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to GM1 gangliosidosis ?,What are the genetic changes related to GM1 gangliosidosis gangliosidosis ?

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to PMM2-congenital disorder of glycosylation ?,"PMM2-CDG is caused by mutations in the PMM2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2). The PMM2 enzyme is involved in a process called glycosylation, which attaches groups of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) to proteins. Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions. Mutations in the PMM2 gene lead to the production of an abnormal PMM2 enzyme with reduced activity. Without a properly functioning PMM2 enzyme, glycosylation cannot proceed normally. As a result, incorrect oligosaccharides are produced and attached to proteins. The wide variety of signs and symptoms in PMM2-CDG are likely due to the production of abnormally glycosylated proteins in many organs and tissues.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""PMM2"", ""full_form"": ""PMM2-congenital disorder of glycosylation""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to PMM2-congenital disorder of glycosylation ?,What are the genetic changes related to PMM2-congenital disorder of glycosylation-congenital disorder of glycosylation ?

    Pregnant women, newborns, and infants
    
Pregnant women, newborns, and infants can be treated, although the parasite is not eliminated completely. The parasites can remain within tissue cells in a less active phase; their location makes it difficult for the medication to completely eliminate them.
    
     
    Persons with ocular disease
    
Persons with ocular toxoplasmosis are sometimes prescribed medicine to treat active disease by their ophthalmologist. Whether or not medication is recommended depends on the size of the eye lesion, the location, and the characteristics of the lesion (acute active, versus chronic not progressing).

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome ?,"Mutations in the HCCS gene or a deletion of genetic material that includes the HCCS gene cause microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome. The HCCS gene carries instructions for producing an enzyme called holocytochrome c-type synthase. This enzyme is active in many tissues of the body and is found in the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells.  Within the mitochondria, the holocytochrome c-type synthase enzyme helps produce a molecule called cytochrome c. Cytochrome c is involved in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, by which mitochondria generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source. It also plays a role in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).  HCCS gene mutations result in a holocytochrome c-type synthase enzyme that cannot perform its function. A deletion of genetic material that includes the HCCS gene prevents the production of the enzyme. A lack of functional holocytochrome c-type synthase enzyme can damage cells by impairing their ability to generate energy. In addition, without the holocytochrome c-type synthase enzyme, the damaged cells may not be able to undergo apoptosis. These cells may instead die in a process called necrosis that causes inflammation and damages neighboring cells. During early development this spreading cell damage may lead to the eye abnormalities and other signs and symptoms of microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome"", ""full_form"": ""MLS""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome ?,What are the genetic changes related to MLS ?

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Cystic Fibrosis ?,"The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) vary from person to person and over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe.
                
One of the first signs of CF that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed, or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born.
                
Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF happen later. They're related to how CF affects the respiratory, digestive, or reproductive systems of the body.
                
Cystic Fibrosis
                

                
Respiratory System Signs and Symptoms
                
People who have CF have thick, sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. This buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. Infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody.
                
People who have CF tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. For example, lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas are much more common in people who have CF than in those who don't. An infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of CF.
                
People who have CF have frequent bouts of sinusitis (si-nu-SI-tis), an infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes, nose, and forehead. Frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) and pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) also can occur. These infections can cause long-term lung damage.
                
As CF gets worse, you may have more serious problems, such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks) or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis).
                
Some people who have CF also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery.
                
Digestive System Signs and Symptoms
                
In CF, mucus can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). These blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines.
                
As a result, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Intestinal blockages also may occur, especially in newborns. Too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort.
                
A hallmark of CF in children is poor weight gain and growth. These children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins.
                
As CF gets worse, other problems may occur, such as:
                
Pancreatitis (PAN-kre-ah-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed, which causes pain.
                
Rectal prolapse. Frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum.
                
Liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts.
                
Diabetes.
                
Gallstones.
                
Reproductive System Signs and Symptoms
                
Men who have CF are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. The vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis.
                
Women who have CF may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other CF complications.
                
Other Signs, Symptoms, and Complications
                
Other signs and symptoms of CF are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood.
                
CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can cause dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death.
                
CF also can cause clubbing and low bone density. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. This sign develops late in CF because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.
                
Low bone density also tends to occur late in CF. It can lead to bone-thinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""Cystic Fibrosis"", ""full_form"": ""CF""}]}",What are the symptoms of Cystic Fibrosis ?,What are the symptoms of CF ?

symptoms,What are the symptoms of IgA Nephropathy ?,"In its early stages, IgA nephropathy may have no symptoms; it can be silent for years or even decades. Once symptoms appear, the most common one is hematuria, or blood in the urine. Hematuria can be a sign of damaged glomeruli. Blood in the urine may appear during or soon after a cold, sore throat, or other respiratory infection. The amount of blood may be
                
- visible with the naked eye. The urine may turn pink or the color of tea or cola. Sometimes a person may have dark or bloody urine.  - so small that it can only be detected using special medical tests.
                
Another symptom of IgA nephropathy is albuminuriawhen a persons urine contains an increased amount of albumin, a protein typically found in the blood, or large amounts of protein in the urine. Albumin is the main protein in the blood. Healthy kidneys keep most proteins in the blood from leaking into the urine. However, when the glomeruli are damaged, large amounts of protein leak out of the blood into the urine.
                
When albumin leaks into the urine, the blood loses its capacity to absorb extra fluid from the body. Too much fluid in the body may cause edema, or swelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face. Foamy urine is another sign of albuminuria. Some people with IgA nephropathy have both hematuria and albuminuria.
                
After 10 to 20 years with IgA nephropathy, about 20 to 40 percent of adults develop end-stage kidney disease.5 Signs and symptoms of end-stage kidney disease may include

inheritance,Is Severe combined immunodeficiency inherited ?,"How is severe combined immunodeficiency inherited? Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) can be inherited in an X-linked recessive or autosomal recessive manner depending on the genetic cause of the condition. X-linked SCID is the most common type of SCID and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. A condition is X-linked if the changed (mutated) gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes; females have two X chromosomes and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. In males, one mutated copy of the responsible gene causes signs and symptoms of the condition because they don't have another X chromosome with a working copy of the gene. In females, having one mutated copy of the gene would make them an unaffected carrier; a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the condition. This is why X-linked recessive disorders, including X-linked SCID, occur much more frequently in males. Because fathers only pass their Y chromosome on to their sons, fathers cannot pass X-linked conditions on to their sons. The other, less common causes of SCID are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. These types are due to mutations in responsible genes on other chromosomes (not the sex chromosomes). In autosomal recessive conditions, a person must have mutations in both copies of the responsible gene in order to have signs or symptoms of the condition. In most cases, the affected person inherits one mutated copy of the gene from each of the parents, who are typically unaffected carriers.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""Severe combined immunodeficiency"", ""full_form"": ""SCID""}]}",Is Severe combined immunodeficiency inherited ?,Is SCID inherited ?

Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.  Some affected individuals inherit a chromosome 11 with a deleted segment from an unaffected parent. In these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems; however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. Individuals with WAGR syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the short arm of chromosome 11, which results in an increased risk of Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and intellectual disability.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""WAGR"", ""full_form"": ""Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary anomalies, and Range of developmental delays""}]}",Is WAGR syndrome inherited ?,"Is Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary anomalies, and Range of developmental delays syndrome inherited ?"
exams and tests,How to diagnose Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) ?,"Diagnostic Challenges
  
For doctors, diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) can be complicated by a number of factors:
  
   - There's no lab test or biomarker for CFS.
   - Fatigue and other symptoms of CFS are common to many illnesses.
   - For some CFS patients, it may not be obvious to doctors that they are ill.
   - The illness has a pattern of remission and relapse.
   - Symptoms vary from person to person in type, number, and severity.
  
  
These factors have contributed to a low diagnosis rate. Of the one to four million Americans who have CFS, less than 20% have been diagnosed.
  Exams and Screening Tests for CFS
  
Because there is no blood test, brain scan, or other lab test to diagnose CFS, the doctor should first rule out other possible causes.
  
If a patient has had 6 or more consecutive months of severe fatigue that is reported to be unrelieved by sufficient bed rest and that is accompanied by nonspecific symptoms, including flu-like symptoms, generalized pain, and memory problems, the doctor should consider the possibility that the patient may have CFS. Further exams and tests are needed before a diagnosis can be made:
  
   - A detailed medical history will be needed and should include a review of medications that could be causing the fatigue and symptoms
   - A thorough physical and mental status examination will also be needed
   - A battery of laboratory screening tests will be needed to help identify or rule out other possible causes of the symptoms that could be treated
   - The doctor may also order additional tests to follow up on results of the initial screening tests
  
  
A CFS diagnosis requires that the patient has been fatigued for 6 months or more and has 4 of the 8 symptoms for CFS for 6 months or more. If, however, the patient has been fatigued for 6 months or more but does not have four of the eight symptoms, the diagnosis may be idiopathic fatigue.
  
The complete process for diagnosing CFS can be found here.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""Proud syndrome"", ""full_form"": ""Protein Related to Ubiquitin and Developmental Disabilities syndrome""}]}",What are the symptoms of Proud syndrome ?,What are the symptoms of Protein Related to Ubiquitin and Developmental Disabilities syndrome ?

What should a patient do if they think they have vancomycin-resistant enterococci? Recommendations and Guidelines General Information For more images of this bacterium, search the Public Health Image Library What is vancomycin-resistant enterococci? Enteroccocci are bacteria that are normally present in the human intestines and in the female genital tract and are often found in the environment. These bacteria can sometimes cause infections. Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat some drug-resistant infections caused by enterococci. In some instances, enterococci have become resistant to this drug and thus are called vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Most VRE infections occur in hospitals. Top of page What types of infections does VRE cause? VRE can live in the human intestines and female genital tract without causing disease (often called colonization). However, sometimes it can cause infections of the urinary tract, the bloodstream, or of wounds associated with catheters or surgical procedures. Top of page Are certain people at risk of getting VRE? The following persons are at increased risk becoming infected with VRE: People who have been previously treated with the antibiotic vancomycin or other antibiotics for long periods of time. People who are hospitalized, particularly when they receive antibiotic treatment for long periods of time. People with weakened immune systems such as patients in intensive care units, or in cancer or transplant wards. People who have undergone surgical procedures such as abdominal or chest surgery. People with medical devices that stay in for some time such as urinary catheters or central intravenous (IV) catheters. People who are colonized with VRE. Top of page What is the treatment for VRE? People with colonized VRE (bacteria are present, but have no symptoms of an infection)  do not need treatment. Most VRE infections can be treated with antibiotics other than vancomycin. Laboratory testing of the VRE can determine which antibiotics will work. For people who get VRE infections in their bladder and have urinary catheters, removal of the catheter when it is no longer needed can also help get rid of the infection. Top of page How is VRE spread? VRE is often passed from person to person by the contaminated hands of caregivers. VRE can get onto a caregiver's hands after they have contact with other people with VRE or after contact with contaminated surfaces. VRE can also be spread directly to people after they touch surfaces that are contaminated with VRE. VRE is not spread through the air by coughing or sneezing. Top of page How can patients prevent the spread of VRE? If a patient or someone in their household has VRE, the following are some things they can do to prevent the spread of VRE: Keep their hands clean. Always wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and before preparing food. Clean their hands after contact with persons who have VRE. Wash with soap and water (particularly when visibly soiled) or use alcohol-based hand rubs. Frequently clean areas of the home, such as bathrooms, that may become contaminated with VRE. Wear gloves if hands may come in contact with body fluids that may contain VRE, such as stool or bandages from infected wounds. Always wash their hands after removing gloves. If someone has VRE, be sure to tell healthcare providers so that they are aware of the infection. Healthcare facilities use special precautions to help prevent the spread of VRE to others. Top of page What should patients do if they think they have vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)? Anyone who thinks they have VRE must talk with their healthcare provider.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis ?,"NASH is usually a silent disease with few or no symptoms. Patients generally feel well in the early stages and only begin to have symptomssuch as fatigue, weight loss, and weaknessonce the disease is more advanced or cirrhosis develops. The progression of NASH can take years, even decades. The process can stop and, in some cases, reverse on its own without specific therapy. Or NASH can slowly worsen, causing scarring or fibrosis to appear and accumulate in the liver. As fibrosis worsens, cirrhosis develops; the liver becomes seriously scarred, hardened, and unable to function normally. Not every person with NASH develops cirrhosis, but once serious scarring or cirrhosis is present, few treatments can halt the progression. A person with cirrhosis experiences fluid retention, muscle wasting, bleeding from the intestines, and liver failure. Liver transplantation is the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis with liver failure, and transplantation is increasingly performed in people with NASH. NASH ranks as one of the major causes of cirrhosis in America, behind hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis"", ""full_form"": ""NASH""}]}",What are the symptoms of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis ?,What are the symptoms of NASH ?
