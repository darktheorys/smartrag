This approach leads to several benefits, including shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, less pain and scarring, and fewer postoperative complications compared to traditional open surgery. In a multi-specialty healthcare institution, adopting MIS can improve patient satisfaction and safety, while also increasing the efficiency of surgical teams and reducing the overall cost associated with long-term patient care.",1,MEDICAL,"Analytical/Evaluative (Convergent Thinking): This merged category is for queries that involve dissecting complex information or data to understand underlying patterns, reasons, or to make informed judgements.
