symptoms,What are the symptoms of Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3 ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Nephrolithiasis 5% Peptic ulcer 5% Chondrocalcinosis - Hypercalcemia - Hypermagnesemia - Hypocalciuria - Multiple lipomas - Pancreatitis - Parathormone-independent increased renal tubular calcium reabsorption - Primary hyperparathyroidism - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""FHH3"", ""full_form"": ""Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3""}]}",What are the symptoms of FHH3 ?,What are the symptoms of Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3 ?,8,[[]],[[]],"[""Familial Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia Type 3""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

treatment,What are the treatments for Diabetic Neuropathies: The Nerve Damage of Diabetes ?,"The first treatment step is to bring blood glucose levels within the normal range to help prevent further nerve damage. Blood glucose monitoring, meal planning, physical activity, and diabetes medicines or insulin will help control blood glucose levels. Symptoms may get worse when blood glucose is first brought under control, but over time, maintaining lower blood glucose levels helps lessen symptoms. Good blood glucose control may also help prevent or delay the onset of further problems. As scientists learn more about the underlying causes of neuropathy, new treatments may become available to help slow, prevent, or even reverse nerve damage.
                
As described in the following sections, additional treatment depends on the type of nerve problem and symptom.
                
Pain Relief
                
Doctors usually treat painful diabetic neuropathy with oral medications, although other types of treatments may help some people. People with severe nerve pain may benefit from a combination of medications or treatments and should consider talking with a health care provider about treatment options.
                
Medications used to help relieve diabetic nerve pain include
                
- tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, imipramine, and desipramine (Norpramin, Pertofrane)  - other types of antidepressants, such as duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine, bupropion (Wellbutrin), paroxetine (Paxil), and citalopram (Celexa)  - anticonvulsants, such as pregabalin (Lyrica), gabapentin (Gabarone, Neurontin), carbamazepine, and lamotrigine (Lamictal)  - opioids and opioidlike drugs, such as controlled-release oxycodone, an opioid; and tramadol (Ultram), an opioid that also acts as an antidepressant
                
Duloxetine and pregabalin are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifically for treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
                
People do not have to be depressed for an antidepressant to help relieve their nerve pain. All medications have side effects, and some are not recommended for use in older adults or those with heart disease. Because over-the-counter pain medicines such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen may not work well for treating most nerve pain and can have serious side effects, some experts recommend avoiding these medications.
                
Treatments that are applied to the skintypically to the feetinclude capsaicin cream and lidocaine patches (Lidoderm, Lidopain). Studies suggest that nitrate sprays or patches for the feet may relieve pain. Studies of alpha-lipoic acid, an antioxidant, and evening primrose oil suggest they may help relieve symptoms and improve nerve function in some patients.
                
A device called a bed cradle can keep sheets and blankets from touching sensitive feet and legs. Acupuncture, biofeedback, or physical therapy may help relieve pain in some people. Treatments that involve electrical nerve stimulation, magnetic therapy, and laser or light therapy may be helpful but need further study. Researchers are also studying several new therapies in clinical trials.
                
Gastrointestinal Problems
                
To relieve mild symptoms of gastroparesisindigestion, belching, nausea, or vomitingdoctors suggest eating small, frequent meals; avoiding fats; and eating less fiber. When symptoms are severe, doctors may prescribe erythromycin to speed digestion, metoclopramide to speed digestion and help relieve nausea, or other medications to help regulate digestion or reduce stomach acid secretion.
                
To relieve diarrhea or other bowel problems, doctors may prescribe an antibiotic such as tetracycline, or other medications as appropriate.
                
Dizziness and Weakness
                
Sitting or standing slowly may help prevent the light-headedness, dizziness, or fainting associated with blood pressure and circulation problems. Raising the head of the bed or wearing elastic stockings may also help. Some people benefit from increased salt in the diet and treatment with salt-retaining hormones. Others benefit from high blood pressure medications. Physical therapy can help when muscle weakness or loss of coordination is a problem.
                
Urinary and Sexual Problems
                
To clear up a urinary tract infection, the doctor will probably prescribe an antibiotic. Drinking plenty of fluids will help prevent another infection. People who have incontinence should try to urinate at regular intervalsevery 3 hours, for examplebecause they may not be able to tell when the bladder is full.
                
To treat erectile dysfunction in men, the doctor will first do tests to rule out a hormonal cause. Several methods are available to treat erectile dysfunction caused by neuropathy. Medicines are available to help men have and maintain erections by increasing blood flow to the penis. Some are oral medications and others are injected into the penis or inserted into the urethra at the tip of the penis. Mechanical vacuum devices can also increase blood flow to the penis. Another option is to surgically implant an inflatable or semirigid device in the penis.
                
Vaginal lubricants may be useful for women when neuropathy causes vaginal dryness. To treat problems with arousal and orgasm, the doctor may refer women to a gynecologist.
                
Foot Care
                
People with neuropathy need to take special care of their feet. The nerves to the feet are the longest in the body and are the ones most often affected by neuropathy. Loss of sensation in the feet means that sores or injuries may not be noticed and may become ulcerated or infected. Circulation problems also increase the risk of foot ulcers. Smoking increases the risk of foot problems and amputation. A health care provider may be able to provide help with quitting smoking.
                
More than 60 percent of all nontraumatic lower-limb amputations in the United States occur in people with diabetes. Nontraumatic amputations are those not caused by trauma such as severe injuries from an accident. In 2004, about 71,000 nontraumatic amputations were performed in people with diabetes. Comprehensive foot care programs can reduce amputation rates by 45 to 85 percent.
                
Careful foot care involves
                
- cleaning the feet daily using warmnot hotwater and a mild soap. Soaking the feet should be avoided. A soft towel can be used to dry the feet and between the toes.  - inspecting the feet and toes every day for cuts, blisters, redness, swelling, calluses, or other problems. Using a mirrorhandheld or placed on the floormay be helpful in checking the bottoms of the feet, or another person can help check the feet. A health care provider should be notified of any problems.  - using lotion to moisturize the feet. Getting lotion between the toes should be avoided.  - filing corns and calluses gently with a pumice stone after a bath or shower.  - cutting toenails to the shape of the toes and filing the edges with an emery board each week or when needed.  - always wearing shoes or slippers to protect feet from injuries. Wearing thick, soft, seamless socks can prevent skin irritation.  - wearing shoes that fit well and allow the toes to move. New shoes can be broken in gradually by first wearing them for only an hour at a time.  - looking shoes over carefully before putting them on and feeling the insides to make sure the shoes are free of tears, sharp edges, or objects that might injure the feet.
                
People who need help taking care of their feet should consider making an appointment to see a foot doctor, also called a podiatrist.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""DN"", ""full_form"": ""Diabetic Neuropathies""}]}",What are the treatments for DN: The Nerve Damage of Diabetes ?,What are the treatments for Diabetic Neuropathies: The Nerve Damage of Diabetes ?,8,"[[""Domain Name"", ""Distinguished Name"", ""Dagens Nyheter"", ""Directory Number"", ""Detroit News"", ""Dominant Negative"", ""Device Number"", ""District Nurse"", ""Diameter Nominal"", ""Department Name""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Diabetic Neuropathy""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers? Because muscle cells and nerve cells have especially high energy needs, muscular and neurological problems are common features of diseases that affect the mitochondria.  MERRF is a progressive multi-system syndrome with symptoms that begin during childhood, but onset may occur in adulthood. The rate of progression varies widely. Onset and extent of symptoms can differ widely from individual to individual and among affected siblings. The classic features of MERRF include: Myoclonus (brief, sudden, twitching muscle spasms)  the most characteristic symptom Epileptic seizures Ataxia (impaired coordination) Ragged-red fibers (a characteristic microscopic abnormality observed in muscle biopsy of patients with MERRF and other mitochondrial disorders) Additional symptoms may include: hearing loss, lactic acidosis (elevated lactic acid level in the blood), short stature, exercise intolerance, dementia, cardiac defects, eye abnormalities, and speech impairment. However, the exact symptoms aren't the same for everyone, because a person with mitochondrial disease can have a unique mixture of healthy and non-working mitochondria, with a unique distribution in the body. Despite their many potential effects, mitochondrial diseases sometimes cause little disability. Sometimes, a person has enough healthy mitochondria to compensate for the defective ones. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of movement 90% EMG abnormality 90% Incoordination 90% Multiple lipomas 90% Myopathy 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Cognitive impairment 50% Short stature 50% Optic atrophy 7.5% Ataxia - Generalized myoclonic seizures - Increased serum lactate - Increased serum pyruvate - Mitochondrial inheritance - Muscle weakness - Myoclonus - Ragged-red muscle fibers - Seizures - Spasticity - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""MERRF"", ""full_form"": ""Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers""}]}",What are the symptoms of MERRF ?,What are the symptoms of Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers ?,8,"[[""Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibres"", ""Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF)"", ""Myoclonic Epilepsy and Ragged Red Fiber (medical condition)"", ""Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy and Red-Ragged Fibres (diabetes research)"", ""Myoclonic Epilepsy and Ragged Red Fiber (medical condition)"", ""Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy and Red-Ragged Fibres (diabetes research)""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

outlook,What is the outlook for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease ?,"Onset of symptoms of CMT is most often in adolescence or early adulthood, however presentation may be delayed until mid-adulthood. Progression of symptoms is very gradual. The degeneration of motor nerves results in muscle weakness and atrophy in the extremities (arms, legs, hands, or feet), and the degeneration of sensory nerves results in a reduced ability to feel heat, cold, and pain. There are many forms of CMT disease. The severity of symptoms may vary greatly among individuals and some people may never realize they have the disorder. CMT is not fatal and people with most forms of CMT have a normal life expectancy.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CMT"", ""full_form"": ""Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease""}]}",What is the outlook for CMT ?,What is the outlook for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease ?,3,"[[""Country Music Television"", ""Charcot Marie Tooth"", ""Constant Maturity Treasury"", ""Certified Massage Therapist"", ""California Mastitis Test"", ""Chartered Market Technician"", ""Certified Medical Transcriptionist"", ""Cut, Make, and Trim"", ""Caravan Motor Touristik"", ""Carlsberg Meridian Telescope""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Certified Medical Transcriptionist""]","Exploratory(Divergent Thinking): Queries that are inherently about seeking new areas of knowledge, understanding emerging trends, or identifying unknown opportunities without a specific end goal of making a decision or judgment.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Six types of standard treatment are used:
                    Photodynamic therapy      Photodynamic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. For skin cancer, laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue. Patients undergoing photodynamic therapy will need to limit the amount of time spent in sunlight.     In one type of photodynamic therapy, called psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy, the patient receives a drug called psoralen and then ultraviolet radiation is directed to the skin. In another type of photodynamic therapy, called extracorporeal photochemotherapy, the patient is given drugs and then some blood cells are taken from the body, put under a special ultraviolet A light, and put back into the body.        Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Sometimes, total skin electron beam (TSEB) radiation therapy is used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome. This is a type of external radiation treatment in which a radiation therapy machine aims electrons (tiny, invisible particles) at the skin covering the whole body.     Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation therapy uses a special lamp or laser that directs UVB radiation at the skin.        Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Sometimes the chemotherapy is topical (put on the skin in a cream, lotion, or ointment). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. (Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.)       Other drug therapy     Topical corticosteroids are used to relieve red, swollen, and inflamed skin. They are a type of steroid. Topical corticosteroids may be in a cream, lotion, or ointment.     Retinoids, such as bexarotene, are drugs related to vitamin A that can slow the growth of certain types of cancer cells. The retinoids may be taken by mouth or put on the skin.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. (Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.)       Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.     Interferon is a type of biologic therapy used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome. It interferes with the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. (Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.)       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy and other types of targeted therapies are used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome.     Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome. Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.    Other types of monoclonal antibody therapy are being studied in clinical trials to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome.      Vorinostat and romidepsin are two of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome. HDAC inhibitors cause a chemical change that stops tumor cells from dividing.     Pralatrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome. It builds up in cancer cells and stops them from using folate, a nutrient needed for cells to divide. Pralatrexate may slow the growth of tumors and kill cancer cells.     See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. (Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.)
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant    This treatment is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the bone marrow or blood of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After therapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.
                
                
                    Treatment for mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""SCDO1"", ""full_form"": ""Spondylocostal dysostosis 1""}]}",What are the symptoms of SCDO1 ?,What are the symptoms of Spondylocostal dysostosis 1 ?,8,"[[""Spondylocostal Dysostosis, Autosomal Recessive 1""]]","[[""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Spondylocostal Dysostosis 1""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

exams and tests,How to diagnose What I need to know about Hirschsprung Disease ?,"HD is diagnosed based on symptoms and test results.
                
A doctor will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your childs bowel movements. HD is much less likely if parents can identify a time when their childs bowel habits were normal.
                
If HD is suspected, the doctor will do one or more tests.
                
X rays
                
An x ray is a black-and-white picture of the inside of the body. To make the large intestine show up better, the doctor may fill it with barium liquid. Barium liquid is inserted into the large intestine through the anus.
                
If HD is the problem, the last segment of the large intestine will look narrower than normal. Just before this narrow segment, the intestine will look bulged. The bulging is caused by blocked stool stretching the intestine.
                
Manometry
                
During manometry, the doctor inflates a small balloon inside the rectum. Normally, the rectal muscles will relax. If the muscles dont relax, HD may be the problem. This test is most often done in older children and adults.
                
Biopsy
                
Biopsy is the most accurate test for HD. The doctor removes a tiny piece of the large intestine and looks at it with a microscope. If nerve cells are missing, HD is the problem.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""HD"", ""full_form"": ""Hirschsprung Disease""}]}",How to diagnose What I need to know about HD ?,How to diagnose What I need to know about Hirschsprung Disease ?,8,"[[""High Definition"", ""Hard Drive"", ""Help Desk"", ""Have Done"", ""Harley Davidson"", ""Heavy Duty"", ""Home Depot"", ""High Density"", ""Heart disease"", ""High Dose""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Huntington's Disease""]","Instructional: Queries specifically seeking step-by-step guidance, instructions, or procedures to perform a task. it focuses on 'how' to do something rather than 'what', 'why', or 'which'.",[9.787912807964563e-08],[1.1062472495126193e-12],"[""High Dose""]",[0.0003681692237515561],"[""ABBREVIATIONS""]","[[3.2026186910132434e-07, 2.3397643649112661e-07, 3.2525634930052614e-12, 1.4659497847596837e-05, 1.0806675183271962e-18, 2.520187532930942e-08, 6.6699240245476154e-09, 4.014134856505968e-05, 0.000266354388077081, 0.0003681692237515561]]",[0.6754864790075981],[0.8519597183426475],"[""Help Desk""]",[0.9338901611234132],"[""ABBREVIATIONS""]","[[0.9013607147410252, 0.8631416504588112, 0.8190640299816905, 0.9338901611234132, 0.778561664340744, 0.8270949787849787, 0.8310148438234746, 0.8832677182804819, 0.8205447202269137, 0.8208957546932081]]","[""Heart disease""]","[""ABBREVIATIONS""]",How to diagnose What I need to know about HD (Help Desk) ?,[false],[true],[false],"[""Diagnosing Huntington's Disease involves a thorough medical history, physical examination, neurological examination, genetic testing, and imaging tests such as MRI or CT scans.""]","[""Hirschsprung Disease is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history review, imaging tests (such as X-rays and barium enema), and a biopsy of the rectum to check for nerve cells.""]","[""Huntington's disease (HD) is diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, family history assessment, neurological tests, and genetic testing.

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis, familial. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Chorea 90% EEG abnormality 90% Seizures 90% Incoordination 50% Migraine 50% Stereotypic behavior 7.5% Anxiety - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Focal seizures, afebril - Generalized seizures - Normal interictal EEG - Paroxysmal choreoathetosis - Paroxysmal dystonia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria ?,"Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria can be caused by mutations in one of several genes: MMACHC, MMADHC, LMBRD1, ABCD4, or HCFC1. Mutations in these genes account for the different types of the disorder, which are known as complementation groups: cblC, cblD, cblF, cblJ, and cblX, respectively.  Each of the above-mentioned genes is involved in the processing of vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin or Cbl. Processing of the vitamin converts it to one of two molecules, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or methylcobalamin (MeCbl). AdoCbl is required for the normal function of an enzyme that helps break down certain amino acids, lipids, and cholesterol. AdoCbl is called a cofactor because it helps the enzyme carry out its function. MeCbl is also a cofactor, but for another enzyme that converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds.  Mutations in the MMACHC, MMADHC, LMBRD1, ABCD4, or HCFC1 gene affect early steps of vitamin B12 processing, resulting in a shortage of both AdoCbl and MeCbl. Without AdoCbl, proteins and lipids are not broken down properly. This defect allows potentially toxic compounds to build up in the body's organs and tissues, causing methylmalonic acidemia. Without MeCbl, homocysteine is not converted to methionine. As a result, homocysteine builds up in the bloodstream and methionine is depleted. Some of the excess homocysteine is excreted in urine (homocystinuria). Researchers have not determined how altered levels of homocysteine and methionine lead to the health problems associated with homocystinuria.  Mutations in other genes involved in vitamin B12 processing can cause related conditions.

treatment,What are the treatments for Marfan Syndrome ?,"Marfan syndrome has no cure. However, treatments can help delay or prevent complications, especially when started early.
                
Marfan syndrome can affect many parts of your body, including your heart, bones and joints, eyes, nervous system, and lungs. The type of treatment you receive will depend on your signs and symptoms.
                
Heart Treatments
                
Aortic dilation, or aortic aneurysm, is the most common and serious heart problem linked to Marfan syndrome. In this condition, the aortathe main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to your bodystretches and grows weak.
                
Medicines are used to try to slow the rate of aortic dilation. Surgery is used to replace the dilated segment of aorta before it tears.
                
If you have Marfan syndrome, you'll need routine care and tests to check your heart valves and aorta.
                
Medicines
                
Beta blockers are medicines that help your heart beat slower and with less force. These medicines may help relieve strain on your aorta and slow the rate of aortic dilation.
                
Some people have side effects from beta blockers, such as tiredness and nausea (feeling sick to your stomach). If side effects occur, your doctor may prescribe a calcium channel blocker or ACE inhibitor instead of a beta blocker. Both medicines help relieve stress on the aorta.
                
Studies suggest that blocking a protein called TGF-beta may help prevent some of the effects of Marfan syndrome. Research shows that the medicine losartan may block the protein in other conditions.
                
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute currently is sponsoring a study comparing losartan to a beta blocker in children and adults who have Marfan syndrome. The study's goal is to find out which medicine, if either, is best at slowing the rate of aortic dilation.
                
Surgery
                
If your aorta stretches, it's more likely to tear (a condition called aortic dissection). To prevent this, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair or replace part of your aorta.
                
Surgery may involve:
                
A composite valve graft. For this surgery, part of the aorta and the aortic valve are removed. The aorta is replaced with a man-made tube called a graft. A man-made valve replaces the original valve.
                
Aortic valve-sparing surgery. If your aortic valve is working well, your doctor may recommend valve-sparing surgery. For this surgery, your doctor replaces the enlarged part of your aorta with a graft. Your aortic valve is left in place.
                
After aortic surgery, you may need medicines or followup tests. For example, after a composite valve graft, your doctor will prescribe medicines called anticoagulants, or ""blood thinners.""
                
Blood thinners help prevent blood clots from forming on your man-made aortic valve. You'll need to take these medicines for the rest of your life. If you've had valve-sparing surgery, you'll only need to take blood thinners for a short time, as your doctor prescribes.
                
If you've had a composite valve graft, you're at increased risk for endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis). This is an infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers and valves. Your doctor may recommend that you take antibiotics before certain medical or dental procedures that increase your risk of endocarditis.
                
Your doctor also may advise you to continue taking beta blockers or other medicines after either type of aortic surgery.
                
After surgery, you may have routine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans to check your aorta.
                
Cardiac MRI is a painless test that uses radio waves and magnets to created detailed pictures of your organs and tissues. Cardiac CT is a painless test that uses an x-ray machine to take clear, detailed pictures of your heart.
                
Bone and Joint Treatments
                
If you have scoliosis (a curved spine), your doctor may suggest a brace or other device to prevent the condition from getting worse. Severe cases of scoliosis may require surgery.
                
Some people who have Marfan syndrome need surgery to repair a chest that sinks in or sticks out. This surgery is done to prevent the chest from pressing on the lungs and heart.
                
Eye Treatments
                
Marfan syndrome can lead to many eye problems, such as a dislocated lens, nearsightedness, early glaucoma (high pressure in the fluid in the eyes), and cataracts (clouding of an eye's lens).
                
Glasses or contact lenses can help with some of these problems. Sometimes surgery is needed.
                
Nervous System Treatments
                
Marfan syndrome can lead to dural ectasia. In this condition, a substance called the dura (which covers the fluid around your brain and spinal cord) stretches and grows weak. This can cause the bones of the spine to wear away. Dural ectasia usually is treated with pain medicines.
                
Lung Treatments
                
Marfan syndrome may cause pneumothorax, or collapsed lung. In this condition, air or gas builds up in the space between the lungs and the chest wall.
                
If the condition is minor, it may go away on its own. However, you may need to have a tube placed through your skin and chest wall to remove the air. Sometimes surgery is needed.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""MS"", ""full_form"": ""Marfan Syndrome""}]}",What are the treatments for MS ?,What are the treatments for Marfan Syndrome ?,8,"[[""Microsoft"", ""Microsoft Corporation"", ""MiSsing"", ""Management Systems"", ""Mississippi"", ""Manuscript"", ""Memory Stick"", ""Mass Spectrometry"", ""Multiple sclerosis"", ""Middle School""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Multiple Sclerosis""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Rh Incompatibility ?,"Rh incompatibility doesn't cause signs or symptoms in a pregnant woman. In a baby, the condition can lead to hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them.
                
Red blood cells contain hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin), an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen to the body. Without enough red blood cells and hemoglobin, the baby won't get enough oxygen.
                
Hemolytic anemia can cause mild to severe signs and symptoms in a newborn, such as jaundice and a buildup of fluid.
                
Jaundice is a yellowish color of the skin and whites of the eyes. When red blood cells die, they release hemoglobin into the blood. The hemoglobin is broken down into a compound called bilirubin. This compound gives the skin and eyes a yellowish color. High levels of bilirubin can lead to brain damage in the baby.
                
The buildup of fluid is a result of heart failure. Without enough hemoglobin-carrying red blood cells, the baby's heart has to work harder to move oxygen-rich blood through the body. This stress can lead to heart failure.

considerations,What to do for Medicare and Continuing Care ?,"Nursing home care can be very expensive. Medicare generally doesn't cover nursing home care. There are many ways people can pay for nursing home care. For example, they can use their own money, they may be able to get help from their state, or they may use long-term care insurance. Nursing home care isn't covered by many types of health insurance. Most people who enter nursing homes begin by paying for their care out of their own pocket. As they use up their resources over a period of time, they may eventually become eligible for Medicaid. Medicaid is a state and Federal program that will pay most nursing home costs for people with limited income and resources. Eligibility varies by state. Medicaid pays for care for about 7 out of every 10 nursing home residents. Medicaid will pay for nursing home care only when provided in a Medicaid-certified facility. For information about Medicaid eligibility, call your state Medical Assistance (Medicaid) Office. If you have questions about Medicaid, you can call your State Medical Assistance (Medicaid) office for more information. Visit http://www.medicare.gov on the web. (Under ""Search Tools,"" select ""Find Helpful Phone Numbers and Websites."") Or, call 1-800-Medicare (1-800-633-4227) to get the telephone number.

causes,What causes GM1 gangliosidosis ?,"What causes GM1 gangliosidosis? All three types of GM1 gangliosidosis are caused by mutations (changes) in the GLB1 gene. This gene gives the body instructions to make an enzyme called beta-galactosidase (-galactosidase), which plays an important role in the brain. The enzyme resides in compartments within cells called lysosomes, where it helps break down certain molecules, including a substance called GM1 ganglioside. GM1 ganglioside is important for nerve cell function in the brain. Mutations in the GLB1 gene may lower or eliminate the activity of the -galactosidase enzyme, keeping GM1 ganglioside from being broken down. As a result, it accumulates to toxic levels in tissues and organs, particularly in the brain. This accumulation leads to the destruction of nerve cells, causing the features of the condition. In general, people with higher enzyme activity levels usually have milder features than those with lower activity levels.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""GM1"", ""full_form"": ""Ganglioside Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside 1""}]}",What causes GM1 gangliosidosis ?,What causes Ganglioside Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside 1 gangliosidosis ?,8,"[[""Gunners Mate First Class"", ""Glycolipid mimic 1"", ""Gunner's Mate 1st Class Petty Officer"", ""Gunner&#39;s Mate First Class (USN Rating)"", ""Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside"", ""Gunner's Mate First Class (USN Rating)""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Ganglioside Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside 1""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

exams and tests,How to diagnose Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome ?,"A specific test to diagnose cyclic vomiting syndrome does not exist; instead, a health care provider will rule out other conditions and diagnose the syndrome based upon
                
- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - a pattern or cycle of symptoms  - blood tests  - urine tests  - imaging tests  - upper GI endoscopy  - a gastric emptying test
                
Often, it is suspected that one of the following is causing their symptoms:
                
- gastroparesisa disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine  - gastroenteritisinflammation of the lining of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine
                
A diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be difficult to make until the person sees a health care provider. A health care provider will suspect cyclic vomiting syndrome if the person suffers from repeat episodes of vomiting.
                
Medical and Family History
                
Taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose cyclic vomiting syndrome. He or she will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history.
                
Physical Exam
                
A physical exam may help diagnose other conditions besides cyclic vomiting syndrome. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually
                
- examines a patients body  - taps on specific areas of the patients body
                
Pattern or Cycle of Symptoms in Children3
                
A health care provider will often suspect cyclic vomiting syndrome in a child when the child
                
- has at least five separate episodes, or at least three separate episodes over 6 months  - has episodes of intense nausea and vomiting lasting 1 hour to 10 days and occurring at least 1 week apart  - has episodes that are similar to previous onesthey tend to start at the same time of day, last the same length of time, and occur with the same symptoms and level of intensity  - vomits during episodes at least four times per hour for at least 1 hour  - vomits and it is not attributed to another disorder  - has absence of nausea and vomiting between episodes
                
Pattern or Cycle of Symptoms in Adults4,5
                
A health care provider will often suspect cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults when the following is present for at least 3 months and the symptoms started more than 6 months ago:
                
- Each episode of cyclic vomiting syndrome is usually similar to previous ones, meaning that episodes tend to start at the same time of day and last the same length of timeless than 1 week.  - Three or more separate episodes in the past year.  - Absence of nausea or vomiting between episodes.
                
Blood Tests
                
A nurse or technician will draw blood samples at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab for analysis. The blood test can tell the health care provider if the patient has any signs of dehydration or other problems.
                
Urine Tests
                
Urinalysis involves testing a urine sample. The patient collects a urine sample in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A health care provider tests the sample in the same location or sends the sample to a lab for analysis. A urinalysis can rule out kidney problems or an infection.
                
Imaging Tests
                
The health care provider decides which test to order based on the symptoms, medical history, and physical exam.
                
Upper GI series. A health care provider may order an upper GI series to look at the upper GI tract. A radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imagingperforms this test at a hospital or an outpatient center. This test does not require anesthesia. The patient should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. During the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Infants lie on a table and a health care provider gives them barium through a tiny tube placed in the nose that runs into the stomach. Barium coats the GI tract, making signs of obstruction or other problems that can cause vomiting show up more clearly on x rays. A patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. The upper GI series can show other problems that may be causing symptoms, such as an ulcer or obstruction.
                
Abdominal ultrasound. A health care provider may order an ultrasound to look at the organs in the abdomen. A technician uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. A radiologist interprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia. The abdominal ultrasound can show other problems that may be causing symptoms, such as gallstones.
                
Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
                
This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. A health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patients throat. A nurse or technician will place an IV needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthesia help a patient stay relaxed and comfortable. The gastroenterologist carefully inserts the endoscope into the mouth and feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. The upper GI endoscopy can show other problems that may be causing symptoms, such as an ulcer. A gastroenterologist may obtain a biopsya procedure that involves taking a small piece of tissue for examination with a microscopeof the small-intestinal lining during an upper GI endoscopy. The patient will not feel the biopsy.
                
Gastric Emptying Test
                
Also called gastric emptying scintigraphy, this test involves eating a bland mealsuch as eggs or an egg substitutethat contains a small amount of radioactive material. A specially trained technician performs the test in a radiology center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the results; the patient does not need anesthesia. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CVS"", ""full_form"": ""Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome""}]}",How to diagnose CVS ?,How to diagnose Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome ?,8,"[[""CVS Corporation"", ""Chorionic Villus Sampling"", ""Concurrent Version System"", ""Council for Voluntary Service"", ""Council for Voluntary Services"", ""Concurrent Versioning System"", ""cardiovascular system"", ""Chorionic Villi Sampling"", ""Consumer Value Stores"", ""Code Versioning System""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Cardiovascular System""]","Instructional: Queries specifically seeking step-by-step guidance, instructions, or procedures to perform a task. it focuses on 'how' to do something rather than 'what', 'why', or 'which'.",[2.4355002815823192e-12],[5.988323848439151e-07],"[""cardiovascular system""]",[5.988323848439151e-07],"[""ABBREVIATIONS""]","[[1.602351741364585e-11, 1.3597117383007263e-21, 1.3731465327750692e-14, 4.6134779396192594e-17, 1.1395807615059078e-15, 5.1464099086003464e-18, 5.988323848439151e-07, 7.211515337142823e-20, 5.048850458602993e-17, 7.303004623253489e-20]]",[0.7978012881991403],[0.8500373220836307],"[""Concurrent Versioning System""]",[0.8537373378094373],"[""ABBREVIATIONS""]","[[0.8376612430173576, 0.6715469189381308, 0.7437436581062835, 0.7376071113453997, 0.7546454820889248, 0.7304236049554871, 0.8537373378094373, 0.6840204115315113, 0.8168871953624937, 0.7537659770967584]]","[""Chorionic Villus Sampling""]","[""ABBREVIATIONS""]",How to diagnose CVS (Concurrent Versioning System) ?,[false],[true],[false],"[""Diagnosing CVS (Cardiovascular System) involves a physical examination, medical history review, imaging tests (such as ECG, echocardiogram), blood tests, and possibly a stress test or cardiac catheterization.""]","[""Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome is diagnosed based on medical history, physical examination, and ruling out other possible causes of symptoms.

information,Do you have information about Weight Loss Surgery,"Summary : Weight loss surgery helps people with extreme obesity to lose weight. It may be an option if you cannot lose weight through diet and exercise or have serious health problems caused by obesity.    There are different types of weight loss surgery. They often limit the amount of food you can take in. Some types of surgery also affect how you digest food and absorb nutrients. All types have risks and complications, such as infections, hernias, and blood clots.    Many people who have the surgery lose weight quickly, but regain some weight later on. If you follow diet and exercise recommendations, you can keep most of the weight off. You will also need medical follow-up for the rest of your life.

susceptibility,Who is at risk for Parasites - Angiostrongyliasis (also known as Angiostrongylus Infection)? ?,"Angiostrongylus cantonensis
    
Angiostrongylus cantonensis, also known as the rat lungworm, is a parasitic nematode (worm) that is transmitted between rats and mollusks (such as slugs or snails) in its natural life cycle. Other animals that become infected such as freshwater shrimp, land crabs, frogs, and planarians of the genus Platydemus, are transport hosts that are not required for reproduction of the parasite but might be able to transmit infection to humans if eaten raw or undercooked. Humans are accidental hosts who do not transmit infection to others. Most cases of infection are diagnosed in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Basin, but the parasite has also been found in Australia, some areas of Africa, the Caribbean, Hawaii and Louisiana. Outbreaks of human angiostrongyliasis have involved a few to hundreds of persons; over 2,800 cases have been reported in the literature from approximately 30 countries. It is likely that the parasite has been spread by rats transported on ships and by the introduction of mollusks such as the giant African land snail (Achatina fulica). In addition, the semi-slug, Parmarion martensi (native of Southeast Asia)has spread in regions of Hawaii and is found to often be infected with A. cantonensis, and the freshwater snail Pomacea canaliculata (native of South America) has been introduced into Taiwan and China and has been implicated in outbreaks of disease in those countries.
    
Risk factors for infection with A. cantonensis include the ingestion of raw or undercooked infected snails or slugs; or pieces of snails and slugs accidentally chopped up in vegetables, vegetable juices, or salads; or foods contaminated by the slime of infected snails or slugs. It is possible that ingestion of raw or undercooked transport hosts (freshwater shrimp, land crabs, frogs, etc. ) can result in human infection, though this is less certain. In addition, contamination of the hands during the preparation of uncooked infected snails or slugs could lead to ingestion of the parasite.
    
     
    Angiostrongylus costaricensis
    
Angiostrongylus costaricensis is a parasitic nematode (worm) that resides in rodents and uses mollusks, such as slugs, as an intermediate host. Rats, such as the cotton rat, transmit the larvae through their feces. Slugs then ingest the larvae. Humans are accidental hosts of the parasite. The parasite is not able to complete its life cycle in humans and eventually dies in the abdomen. Human infection principally occurs in Latin America and the Caribbean, with a few cases suspected in the United States and in the Republic of Congo. The organism is also found in animals in the Southern U.S. (Texas).
    
Risk factors for infection with A. costaricensis are not well established but are likely to be ingestion of infected slugs or raw vegetables or vegetable juices contaminated with slugs or their slime, which can contain A. costaricensis larvae. The infection of transport hosts, which are not essential to the lifecycle of the parasite, has not been identified and any role in human infection is not known, in contrast to A. cantonensis. Some reports have shown the case rate to be higher in children 6 to 12 years of age, males, and in persons of higher socioeconomic status. There has been one food-related outbreak in Guatemala that affected primarily adults.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""Angiostrongyliasis"", ""full_form"": ""Angiostrongylus Infection""}]}",Who is at risk for Parasites - Angiostrongyliasis (also known as Angiostrongyliasis)? ?,Who is at risk for Parasites - Angiostrongyliasis (also known as Angiostrongylus Infection)? ?,8,[[]],[[]],"[""Angiostrongyliasis""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

information,Do you have information about Child Development,"Summary : As children grow older, they develop in several different ways. Child development includes physical, intellectual, social, and emotional changes.    Children grow and mature at very different rates. It's hard to say what ""normal"" is. There can be big differences in height, weight, and build among healthy children. Diet, exercise and genes are all factors. Some children begin puberty or are close to it before they are teenagers.    Children start to become more independent from their parents. They may rebel. They also look outward - to their friends, who are usually of the same sex. Peer approval becomes very important. Your child may try new behaviors to be part of ""the group."" This can also be the time that parents or teachers recognize learning disabilities or behavioral problems in children.

causes,What causes Best vitelliform macular dystrophy ?,"What causes Best vitelliform macular dystrophy? Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is caused by changes (mutations) in the BEST1 gene. This gene gives the body instructions for making a protein called bestrophin. Bestrophin acts as a channel that controls the movement of chloride ions within the retina. It is thought that mutations in the BEST1 gene affect the shape of the channel and its ability to properly regulate the flow of chloride. However, it is unclear how exactly this relates to the specific features of BVMD.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""BMD"", ""full_form"": ""Best vitelliform macular dystrophy""}]}",What causes BMD ?,What causes Best vitelliform macular dystrophy ?,0,"[[""Bone mineral density"", ""Ballistic Missile Defense"", ""Bermuda Dollar"", ""Births Marriages And Deaths"", ""Birth, Marriage, And Death"", ""Bernese Mountain Dog"", ""Blue Mystery Data"", ""Belo, Madagascar"", ""Biblioteca M\u00e9dica Digital"", ""Bending Moment Diagram""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Bone Mineral Density""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Primary spontaneous pneumothorax ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Primary spontaneous pneumothorax? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Primary spontaneous pneumothorax. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the pleura 90% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Incomplete penetrance - Spontaneous pneumothorax - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""PSP"", ""full_form"": ""Primary spontaneous pneumothorax""}]}",What are the symptoms of PSP ?,What are the symptoms of Primary spontaneous pneumothorax ?,8,"[[""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Play Station Portable"", ""Progressive supranuclear palsy"", ""Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning"", ""Personal Software Process"", ""Portable Sony Playstation"", ""Partido Socialista Popular"", ""Payphone Service Provider"", ""Program Segment Prefix"", ""Private Sector Participation""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Progressive Supranuclear Palsy""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of ADNP syndrome ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of ADNP syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for ADNP syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of cardiovascular system morphology 5% Seizures 5% Autistic behavior - Cleft eyelid - Feeding difficulties - Hyperactivity - Hypermetropia - Intellectual disability - Joint laxity - Language impairment - Muscular hypotonia - Obesity - Obsessive-compulsive behavior - Prominent forehead - Ptosis - Recurrent infections - Short nose - Short stature - Small hand - Smooth philtrum - Stereotypic behavior - Strabismus - Visual impairment - Wide nasal bridge - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""ADNP"", ""full_form"": ""Activity-Dependent Neuroprotector Homeobox""}]}",What are the symptoms of ADNP syndrome ?,What are the symptoms of Activity-Dependent Neuroprotector Homeobox syndrome ?,8,"[[""Activity dependent neuroprotective protein"", ""Arizona Digital Newspaper Program"", ""Abu Dhabi National Properties"", ""activity-dependent neuroprotective homeobox"", ""Arab Democratic Nasserist Party"", ""Activity Dependent Neuroprotective Protein"", ""Associate Degree Nursing Program"", ""Activity Dependent Neuroprotective Protein"", ""Associate Degree Nursing Program""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Activity-Dependent Neuroprotector Homeobox""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

inheritance,Is Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers inherited ?,"Is myoclonic epilepsy associated with ragged red fibers genetic? If so, how is it inherited? MERRF is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA and is transmitted by maternal inheritance. It is called maternal inheritance because a child inherits the great majority of their mitochondria from their mother through the egg.   The Centre for Genetics Education provides a detail description of maternal inheritance.  The mother of an individual with MERRF usually has a mitochondrial mutation and may or may not have symptoms.  Or, an individual with MERRF may have a mitochondrial mutation that just occurred in them, called a de novo mutation.  If the mother has the mitochondrial mutation, all of her children will inherit the mutation and may or may not have symptoms.  All of her daughters children will also inherit the mitochondrial mutation.  Her son's children are not at risk of inheriting the mutation.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""MERRF"", ""full_form"": ""Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers""}]}",Is MERRF inherited ?,Is Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers inherited ?,8,"[[""Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibres"", ""Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF)"", ""Myoclonic Epilepsy and Ragged Red Fiber (medical condition)"", ""Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy and Red-Ragged Fibres (diabetes research)"", ""Myoclonic Epilepsy and Ragged Red Fiber (medical condition)"", ""Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy and Red-Ragged Fibres (diabetes research)""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

exams and tests,How to diagnose Iron-Deficiency Anemia ?,"Your doctor will diagnose iron-deficiency anemia based on your medical history, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.
                
Once your doctor knows the cause and severity of the condition, he or she can create a treatment plan for you.
                
Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia may have no signs or symptoms. Thus, you may not know you have it unless your doctor discovers it from a screening test or while checking for other problems.
                
Specialists Involved
                
Primary care doctors often diagnose and treat iron-deficiency anemia. These doctors include pediatricians, family doctors, gynecologists/obstetricians, and internal medicine specialists.
                
A hematologist (a blood disease specialist), a gastroenterologist (a digestive system specialist), and other specialists also may help treat iron-deficiency anemia.
                
Medical History
                
Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and any past problems you've had with anemia or low iron. He or she also may ask about your diet and whether you're taking any medicines.
                
If you're a woman, your doctor may ask whether you might be pregnant.
                
Physical Exam
                
Your doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs of iron-deficiency anemia. He or she may:
                
Look at your skin, gums, and nail beds to see whether they're pale
                
Listen to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats
                
Listen to your lungs for rapid or uneven breathing
                
Feel your abdomen to check the size of your liver and spleen
                
Do a pelvic and rectal exam to check for internal bleeding
                
Diagnostic Tests and Procedures
                
Many tests and procedures are used to diagnose iron-deficiency anemia. They can help confirm a diagnosis, look for a cause, and find out how severe the condition is.
                
Complete Blood Count
                
Often, the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood.
                
This test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia.
                
The normal range of these levels varies in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you.
                
The CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of infection, a blood disorder, or another condition.
                
Finally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. The results may be a clue as to the cause of your anemia. In iron-deficiency anemia, for example, red blood cells usually are smaller than normal.
                
Other Blood Tests
                
If the CBC results confirm you have anemia, you may need other blood tests to find out what's causing the condition, how severe it is, and the best way to treat it.
                
Reticulocyte count. This test measures the number of reticulocytes (re-TIK-u-lo-sites) in your blood. Reticulocytes are young, immature red blood cells. Over time, reticulocytes become mature red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout your body.
                
A reticulocyte count shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate.
                
Peripheral smear. For this test, a sample of your blood is examined under a microscope. If you have iron-deficiency anemia, your red blood cells will look smaller and paler than normal.
                
Tests to measure iron levels. These tests can show how much iron has been used from your body's stored iron. Tests to measure iron levels include:
                
Serum iron. This test measures the amount of iron in your blood. The level of iron in your blood may be normal even if the total amount of iron in your body is low. For this reason, other iron tests also are done.
                
Serum ferritin. Ferritin is a protein that helps store iron in your body. A measure of this protein helps your doctor find out how much of your body's stored iron has been used.
                
Transferrin level, or total iron-binding capacity. Transferrin is a protein that carries iron in your blood. Total iron-binding capacity measures how much of the transferrin in your blood isn't carrying iron. If you have iron-deficiency anemia, you'll have a high level of transferrin that has no iron.
                
Other tests. Your doctor also may recommend tests to check your hormone levels, especially your thyroid hormone. You also may have a blood test for a chemical called erythrocyte protoporphyrin. This chemical is a building block for hemoglobin.
                
Children also may be tested for the level of lead in their blood. Lead can make it hard for the body to produce hemoglobin.
                
Tests and Procedures for Gastrointestinal Blood Loss
                
To check whether internal bleeding is causing your iron-deficiency anemia, your doctor may suggest a fecal occult blood test. This test looks for blood in the stools and can detect bleeding in the intestines.
                
If the test finds blood, you may have other tests and procedures to find the exact spot of the bleeding. These tests and procedures may look for bleeding in the stomach, upper intestines, colon, or pelvic organs.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""IDA"", ""full_form"": ""Iron-Deficiency Anemia""}]}",How to diagnose IDA ?,How to diagnose Iron-Deficiency Anemia ?,8,"[[""International Development Association"", ""Institute for Defense Analyses"", ""Industrial Development Agency"", ""Individual Development Account"", ""Investment Dealers Association"", ""Iron Deficiency Anemia"", ""In Defense of Animals"", ""IdaCorp, Inc."", ""Instituto de Desarrollo Agrario"", ""Institute for Defense Analysis""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Iron Deficiency Anemia""]","Instructional: Queries specifically seeking step-by-step guidance, instructions, or procedures to perform a task. it focuses on 'how' to do something rather than 'what', 'why', or 'which'.",[2.352802723559212e-09],[4.585323372876775e-08],"[""Iron Deficiency Anemia""]",[4.585323372876775e-08],"[""ABBREVIATIONS""]","[[1.2455656192725602e-14, 7.543274888148357e-20, 9.996166936110834e-16, 4.238095990323371e-18, 3.336330149485934e-14, 4.585323372876775e-08, 2.507943651111587e-15, 1.8819324540983017e-16, 2.2199315942177532e-27, 1.0350201223178609e-18]]",[0.9470361197814903],[0.9486129320975808],"[""Investment Dealers Association""]",[0.9486129320975808],"[""ABBREVIATIONS""]","[[0.730629949796954, 0.6972732675238771, 0.6975291783715651, 0.6764369644360548, 0.600768702156828, 0.9486129320975808, 0.6685784775435349, 0.719520787711772, 0.657109024893139, 0.6829598783552675]]","[""Iron Deficiency Anemia""]","[""ABBREVIATIONS""]",How to diagnose IDA (Investment Dealers Association) ?,[true],[true],[true],"[""Diagnosing Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) involves performing blood tests such as complete blood count (CBC), serum ferritin levels, and iron studies.

inheritance,Is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis inherited ?,"Most cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are sporadic; they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  Familial pulmonary fibrosis appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

considerations,What to do for Renal Artery Stenosis ?,"Limiting intake of fats, cholesterol, sodium, and sugar can help prevent atherosclerosis, which can lead to RAS. Most sodium in the diet comes from salt. A healthy diet that prevents people from becoming overweight or obese can also help prevent atherosclerosis. People with RAS that has caused decreased kidney function should limit their intake of protein, cholesterol, sodium, and potassium to slow the progression of kidney failure. More information about nutrition for CKD is provided in the NIDDK health topics, Nutrition for Early Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults and Nutrition for Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults.

inheritance,Is X-linked juvenile retinoschisis inherited ?,"This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""XLRS"", ""full_form"": ""X-linked juvenile retinoschisis""}]}",Is XLRS inherited ?,Is X-linked juvenile retinoschisis inherited ?,8,"[[""X-linked juvenile retinoschisis""]]","[[""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""X-linked Retinoschisis""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

They also help form red blood cells. You can get B vitamins from proteins such as fish, poultry, meat, eggs, and dairy products. Leafy green vegetables, beans, and peas also have B vitamins. Many cereals and some breads have added B vitamins.    Not getting enough of certain B vitamins can cause diseases. A lack of B12 or B6 can cause anemia.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""B"", ""full_form"": ""B Vitamins""}]}",Do you have information about B,Do you have information about B Vitamins,0,"[[""Be"", ""Business"", ""Back"", ""Big"", ""Body"", ""Basic"", ""Buy"", ""Base"", ""Bad"", ""British""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Boron""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

causes,What causes Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Skin Manifestation of Celiac Disease (For Health Care Professionals) ?,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is caused by the deposit of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the skin, which triggers further immunologic reactions resulting in lesion formation. DH is an external manifestation of an abnormal immune response to gluten, in which IgA antibodies form against the skin antigen epidermal transglutaminase.
                
Family studies show that 5 percent of first-degree relatives of a person with DH will also have DH. An additional 5 percent of first-degree relatives of a person with DH will have celiac disease.4 Various other autoimmune diseases are associated with DH, the most common being hypothyroidism.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""DH"", ""full_form"": ""Dermatitis Herpetiformis""}, {""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CD"", ""full_form"": ""Celiac Disease""}]}",What causes DH: Skin Manifestation of CD (For Health Care Professionals) ?,What causes Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Skin Manifestation of Celiac Disease (For Health Care Professionals) ?,8,"[[""Downhill"", ""Das Heisst"", ""Don't Have ...."", ""Diffie-Hellman"", ""De Havilland"", ""Dark Horse"", ""Designated Hitter"", ""Data Handling"", ""Double Helix"", ""Dear Husband""], [""Compact Disc"", ""Compact Disc - Music, software programs and digital media"", ""Celine Dion"", ""Cadmium"", ""Christian Dior"", ""Canadian Dollar"", ""Compact Disk"", ""Cardiovascular Disease"", ""Compact Disk description"", ""Compact Design""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""], [""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Dermatitis Herpetiformis"", ""Celiac Disease""]","Analytical/Evaluative (Convergent Thinking): This merged category is for queries that involve dissecting complex information or data to understand underlying patterns, reasons, or to make informed judgements.

treatment,What are the treatments for Central Cord Syndrome ?,"There is no cure for central cord syndrome although some people recover near-normal function. There is no standard course of treatment, although drug therapy, surgery, and rest are often part of the program. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to indicate the degree of spinal cord compression and vertebral instability. Vertebral instability due to acute traumatic injury or cervical disc herniation is often treated by surgery to prevent further damage to the spinal cord. Recent reports indicate that earlier surgery may improve chances for recovery. Numerous recent studies suggest that surgery also can be beneficial in individuals with persistent compression of the spinal cord and ongoing neurological deterioration.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CCS"", ""full_form"": ""Central Cord Syndrome""}]}",What are the treatments for CCS ?,What are the treatments for Central Cord Syndrome ?,8,"[[""Castle & Cooke, Incorporated"", ""Caracas, Venezuela"", ""Canadian Cancer Society"", ""Card Captor Sakura"", ""Common Channel Signaling"", ""Certified Coding Specialist"", ""Coded Character Set"", ""Command and Control System"", ""Call Center Service"", ""Campus Computing Site""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Chronic Cough Syndrome""]","Exploratory(Divergent Thinking): Queries that are inherently about seeking new areas of knowledge, understanding emerging trends, or identifying unknown opportunities without a specific end goal of making a decision or judgment.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency ?,"Mutations in the CPT1A gene cause CPT I deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, which is found in the liver. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A is essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them into energy. Fatty acid oxidation takes place within mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. A group of fats called long-chain fatty acids cannot enter mitochondria unless they are attached to carnitine. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A connects carnitine to long-chain fatty acids so they can enter mitochondria and be used to produce energy. During periods of fasting, long-chain fatty acids are an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.  Mutations in the CPT1A gene severely reduce or eliminate the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A. Without enough of this enzyme, carnitine is not attached to long-chain fatty acids. As a result, these fatty acids cannot enter mitochondria and be converted into energy. Reduced energy production can lead to some of the features of CPT I deficiency, such as hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Fatty acids may also build up in cells and damage the liver, heart, and brain. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of the disorder.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CPT I"", ""full_form"": ""carnitine palmitoyltransferase I""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to CPT I deficiency ?,What are the genetic changes related to carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency ?,8,"[[""Core Pre-Tax Income"", ""Counselling & Psychotherapy Training Institute"", ""Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I (medical disorder)"", ""Commercial Pure Titanium"", ""Counselling and Psychotherapy Training Institute (Edinburgh, Scotland, UK)"", ""Committee on Pipe and Tube Imports"", ""Canadian Petroleum Training Institute"", ""Center for Patent and Trademark Information"", ""Collaborative Practice Training Institute (Lynchburg, VA)"", ""Concrete Polishing Technical Institute"", ""Conscience and Peace Tax International""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER""]]","[""Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

considerations,What to do for Ulcerative Colitis ?,"- Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, or long lasting, disease that causes inflammationirritation or swellingand sores called ulcers on the inner lining of the large intestine.  - The exact cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown. Researchers believe that factors such as an overactive intestinal immune system, genes, and environment may play a role in causing ulcerative colitis.  - Ulcerative colitis can occur in people of any age. However, it is more likely to develop in people      - between the ages of 15 and 30    - older than 60    - who have a family member with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)    - of Jewish descent    - The most common signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis are diarrhea with blood or pus and abdominal discomfort.  - A health care provider diagnoses ulcerative colitis with the following:      - medical and family history    - physical exam    - lab tests    - endoscopies of the large intestine    - Which treatment a person needs depends on the severity of the disease and symptoms.  - Good nutrition is important in the management of ulcerative colitis. A health care provider may recommend that a person make dietary changes.  - People with ulcerative colitis should talk with their health care provider about how often they should get screened for colon cancer.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""UC"", ""full_form"": ""Ulcerative Colitis""}]}",What to do for UC ?,What to do for Ulcerative Colitis ?,2,"[[""University of California"", ""University of Chicago"", ""University College"", ""Un-Changed"", ""University of Colorado"", ""Un-Conscious"", ""Under Construction"", ""University of Cincinnati"", ""Upon Completion"", ""Ulcerative Colitis""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Ulcerative Colitis""]","Instructional: Queries specifically seeking step-by-step guidance, instructions, or procedures to perform a task. it focuses on 'how' to do something rather than 'what', 'why', or 'which'.",[3.551536788807049e-06],[3.551536788807049e-06],"[""Upon Completion""]",[1.1962696844482808e-05],"[""ABBREVIATIONS""]","[[1.1216490197925907e-16, 4.994532773199237e-14, 2.3156213741410174e-07, 2.4539970441533306e-09, 1.6131830136005978e-15, 1.0251178074450958e-08, 2.6631665243899027e-06, 1.4699743535391331e-19, 1.1962696844482808e-05, 3.551536788807049e-06]]",[0.9117302137538443],[0.9116514151917334],"[""Upon Completion""]",[0.9116514151917334],"[""ABBREVIATIONS""]","[[0.7354032119023616, 0.6980517383685823, 0.7580463490186357, 0.7747585971172882, 0.7111071640210747, 0.696092818745592, 0.6358156166071185, 0.7116130545829649, 0.7224061501136106, 0.9116514151917334]]","[""Ulcerative Colitis""]","[""ABBREVIATIONS""]",What to do for UC (Upon Completion) ?,[true],[true],[false],"[""For Ulcerative Colitis (UC), it is important to follow a treatment plan prescribed by a healthcare provider, which may include medications, dietary changes, stress management, and regular monitoring.

susceptibility,Who is at risk for Metabolic Syndrome? ?,"People at greatest risk for metabolic syndrome have these underlying causes:
                
Abdominal obesity (a large waistline)
                
An inactive lifestyle
                
Insulin resistance
                
Some people are at risk for metabolic syndrome because they take medicines that cause weight gain or changes in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. These medicines most often are used to treat inflammation, allergies, HIV, and depression and other types of mental illness.
                
Populations Affected
                
Some racial and ethnic groups in the United States are at higher risk for metabolic syndrome than others. Mexican Americans have the highest rate of metabolic syndrome, followed by whites and blacks.
                
Other groups at increased risk for metabolic syndrome include:
                
People who have a personal history of diabetes
                
People who have a sibling or parent who hasdiabetes
                
Women when compared with men
                
Women who have a personal history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (a tendency to develop cysts on the ovaries)
                
Heart Disease Risk
                
Metabolic syndrome increases your risk for coronary heart disease. Other risk factors, besides metabolic syndrome, also increase your risk for heart disease. For example, a high LDL (bad) cholesterol level and smoking are major risk factors for heart disease. For details about all of the risk factors for heart disease, go to the Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors HealthTopic.
                
Even if you dont have metabolic syndrome, you should find out your short-term risk for heart disease. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) divides short-term heart disease risk into four categories. Your risk category depends on which risk factors you have and how many you have.
                
Your risk factors are used to calculate your 10-year risk of developing heart disease. The NCEP has an online calculator that you can use to estimate your 10-year risk of having a heart attack.
                
High risk: Youre in this category if you already have heart disease or diabetes, or if your 10-year risk score is more than 20 percent.
                
Moderately high risk: Youre in this category if you have two or more risk factors and your 10-year risk score is 10 percent to 20 percent.
                
Moderate risk: Youre in this category if you have two or more risk factors and your 10-year risk score is less than 10 percent.
                
Lower risk: Youre in this category if you have zero or one risk factor.
                
Even if your 10-year risk score isnt high, metabolic syndrome will increase your risk for coronary heart disease over time.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""MetS"", ""full_form"": ""Metabolic Syndrome""}]}",Who is at risk for MetS? ?,Who is at risk for Metabolic Syndrome? ?,8,"[[""Metastases"", ""Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard"", ""New York Metropolitans"", ""Metadata Encoding Transmission Standard"", ""METeorological System"", ""Met Coil Systems Corporation (de-listed)"", ""Mechanized Export Traffic System"", ""Materials and Equipment Trading Service"", ""Mayor's Emergency Telephone System"", ""Mini-Effluent Treatment System""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Metabolic Syndrome""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 ?,"X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 is caused by genetic changes involving the ARSE gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called arylsulfatase E. The function of this enzyme is unknown, although it appears to be important for normal skeletal development and is thought to participate in a chemical pathway involving vitamin K. Evidence suggests that vitamin K normally plays a role in bone growth and maintenance of bone density.  Between 60 and 75 percent of males with the characteristic features of X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 have a mutation in the ARSE gene. These mutations reduce or eliminate the function of arylsulfatase E. Another 25 percent of affected males have a small deletion of genetic material from the region of the X chromosome that contains the ARSE gene. These individuals are missing the entire gene, so their cells produce no functional arylsulfatase E. Researchers are working to determine how a shortage of arylsulfatase E disrupts the development of bones and cartilage and leads to the characteristic features of X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1.  Some people with the features of X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 do not have an identified mutation in the ARSE gene or a deletion involving the gene. Other, as-yet-unidentified genetic and environmental factors may also be involved in causing this disorder.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""XLC1"", ""full_form"": ""X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to XLC1 ?,What are the genetic changes related to X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 ?,8,[[]],[[]],"[""X-linked cleft palate and ankyloglossia 1""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

exams and tests,How to diagnose Immune Thrombocytopenia ?,"Your doctor will diagnose immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.
                
Your doctor will want to make sure that your low platelet count isn't due to another condition (such as an infection) or medicines you're taking (such as chemotherapy medicines or aspirin).
                
Medical History
                
Your doctor may ask about:
                
Your signs and symptoms of bleeding and any other signs or symptoms you're having
                
Whether you have illnesses that could lower your platelet count or cause bleeding
                
Medicines or any over-the-counter supplements or remedies you take that could cause bleeding or lower your platelet count
                
Physical Exam
                
During a physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of bleeding and infection. For example, your doctor may look for purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes and pinpoint red spots on the skin. These are signs of bleeding under the skin.
                
Diagnostic Tests
                
You'll likely have blood tests to check your platelet count. These tests usually include:
                
A complete blood count. This test checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. In ITP, the red and white blood cell counts are normal, but the platelet count is low.
                
A blood smear. For this test, some of your blood is put on a slide. A microscope is used to look at your platelets and other blood cells.
                
You also may have a blood test to check for the antibodies (proteins) that attack platelets.
                
If blood tests show that your platelet count is low, your doctor may recommend more tests to confirm a diagnosis of ITP. For example, bone marrow tests can show whether your bone marrow is making enough platelets.
                
If you're at risk for HIV, hepatitis C, or H. pylori, your doctor may screen you for these infections, which might be linked to ITP.
                
Some people who have mild ITP have few or no signs of bleeding. They may be diagnosed only if a blood test done for another reason shows that they have low platelet counts.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""ITP"",

causes,What causes Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome ?,What causes glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome? Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1 deficiency syndrome) is caused by changes (mutations) in the SLC2A1 gene. This gene encodes a protein that helps transport glucose (a simple sugar) into cells where it is used as fuel. The protein is particularly important in the central nervous system since glucose is the brain's main source of energy. SLC2A1 mutations impair the function of the protein. This significantly reduces the amount of glucose available to brain cells leading to the many signs and symptoms associated with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.,"{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""GLUT1"", ""full_form"": ""Glucose transporter type 1""}]}",What causes GLUT1 deficiency syndrome ?,What causes Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome ?,8,[[]],[[]],"[""Glucose Transporter Type 1""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

information,Do you have information about Kidney Transplantation,"Summary : A kidney transplant is an operation that places a healthy kidney in your body. The transplanted kidney takes over the work of the two kidneys that failed, so you no longer need dialysis.     During a transplant, the surgeon places the new kidney in your lower abdomen and connects the artery and vein of the new kidney to your artery and vein. Often, the new kidney will start making urine as soon as your blood starts flowing through it. But sometimes it takes a few weeks to start working.     Many transplanted kidneys come from donors who have died. Some come from a living family member. The wait for a new kidney can be long.    If you have a transplant, you must take drugs for the rest of your life, to keep your body from rejecting the new kidney.

inheritance,Is Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 inherited ?,"How is hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 inherited? Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSN1) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause signs and symptoms of the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated gene from the affected parent. In rare cases, a mutation that causes HSN1 occurs sporadically as a new (de novo) mutation in a person without an affected parent.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""HSN1"", ""full_form"": ""Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1""}]}",Is HSN1 inherited ?,Is Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 inherited ?,8,"[[""Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy Type 1""]]","[[""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy Type 1""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to activated PI3K-delta syndrome ?,"Activated PI3K-delta syndrome is caused by mutations in the PIK3CD gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called p110 delta (p110). This protein is one piece (subunit) of an enzyme called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which turns on signaling pathways within cells. The version of PI3K containing the p110 subunit, called PI3K-delta, is specifically found in white blood cells, including B cells and T cells. PI3K-delta signaling is involved in the growth and division (proliferation) of white blood cells, and it helps direct B cells and T cells to mature (differentiate) into different types, each of which has a distinct function in the immune system.  PIK3CD gene mutations involved in activated PI3K-delta syndrome lead to production of an altered p110 protein. A PI3K-delta enzyme containing the altered subunit is abnormally turned on (activated). Studies indicate that overactive PI3K-delta signaling alters the differentiation of B cells and T cells, leading to production of cells that cannot respond to infections and that die earlier than usual. Lack of functioning B cells and T cells makes it difficult for people with this disorder to fight off bacterial and viral infections. Overactivation of PI3K-delta signaling can also stimulate abnormal proliferation of white blood cells, leading to lymphadenopathy and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia in some affected individuals. An increase in B cell proliferation in combination with reduced immune system function may contribute to development of B-cell lymphoma.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""PI3K-delta"", ""full_form"": ""Phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to activated PI3K-delta syndrome ?,What are the genetic changes related to activated Phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome ?,8,[[]],[[]],"[""Phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta""]","Exploratory(Divergent Thinking): Queries that are inherently about seeking new areas of knowledge, understanding emerging trends, or identifying unknown opportunities without a specific end goal of making a decision or judgment.

information,Do you have information about Radiation Therapy,"Summary : Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment. It uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and stop them from spreading. About half of all cancer patients receive it. The radiation may be external, from special machines, or internal, from radioactive substances that a doctor places inside your body. The type of radiation therapy you receive depends on many factors, including       - The type of cancer    - The size of the cancer    - The cancer's location in the body    - How close the cancer is to normal tissues that are sensitive to radiation    - How far into the body the radiation needs to travel    - Your general health and medical history    - Whether you will have other types of cancer treatment    - Other factors, such as your age and other medical conditions       Radiation therapy can damage normal cells as well as cancer cells. Treatment must be carefully planned to minimize side effects. Common side effects include skin changes and fatigue. Other side effects depend on the part of your body being treated.    Sometimes radiation is used with other treatments, like surgery or chemotherapy.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Convulsions benign familial neonatal dominant form ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Convulsions benign familial neonatal dominant form? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Convulsions benign familial neonatal dominant form. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Generalized tonic-clonic seizures - Hypertonia - Normal interictal EEG - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""BFND"", ""full_form"": ""Convulsions benign familial neonatal dominant form""}]}",What are the symptoms of BFND ?,What are the symptoms of Convulsions benign familial neonatal dominant form ?,8,"[[""Bobcat Fight Never Dies"", ""Buero Fuer Neues Denken""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Benign Familial Neonatal Seizures""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

treatment,What are the treatments for Aplastic Anemia ?,"Treatments for aplastic anemia include blood transfusions, blood and marrow stem cell transplants, and medicines. These treatments can prevent or limit complications, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life.
                
Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may cure the disorder in some people who are eligible for a transplant. Removing a known cause of aplastic anemia, such as exposure to a toxin, also may cure the condition.
                
Who Needs Treatment
                
People who have mild or moderate aplastic anemia may not need treatment as long as the condition doesn't get worse. People who have severe aplastic anemia need medical treatment right away to prevent complications.
                
People who have very severe aplastic anemia need emergency medical care in a hospital. Very severe aplastic anemia can be fatal if it's not treated right away.
                
Blood Transfusions
                
Blood transfusions can help keep blood cell counts at acceptable levels. A blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels.
                
Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.
                
Blood transfusions help relieve the symptoms of aplastic anemia, but they're not a permanent treatment.
                
Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplants
                
A blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces damaged stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor).
                
During the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein in your chest. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.
                
Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may cure aplastic anemia in people who can have this type of treatment. The transplant works best in children and young adults with severe aplastic anemia who are in good health and who have matched donors.
                
Older people may be less able to handle the treatments needed to prepare the body for the transplant. They're also more likely to have complications after the transplant.
                
If you have aplastic anemia, talk with your doctor about whether a blood and marrow stem cell transplant is an option for you.
                
Medicines
                
If you have aplastic anemia, your doctor may prescribe medicines to:
                
Stimulate your bone marrow
                
Suppress your immune system
                
Prevent and treat infections
                
Medicines To Stimulate Bone Marrow
                
Man-made versions of substances that occur naturally in the body can stimulate the bone marrow to make more blood cells. Examples of these types of medicines include erythropoietin and colony-stimulating factors.
                
These medicines have some risks. You and your doctor will work together to decide whether the benefits of these medicines outweigh the risks. If this treatment works well, it can help you avoid the need for blood transfusions.
                
Medicines To Suppress the Immune System
                
Research suggests that aplastic anemia may sometimes occur because the body's immune system attacks its own cells by mistake. For this reason, your doctor may prescribe medicines to suppress your immune system.
                
These medicines allow your bone marrow to start making blood cells again. They also may help you avoid the need for blood transfusions.
                
Medicines that suppress the immune system don't cure aplastic anemia. However, they can relieve its symptoms and reduce complications. These medicines often are used for people who can't have blood and marrow stem cell transplants or who are waiting for transplants.
                
Three medicinesoften given togethercan suppress the body's immune system. They are antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporine, and methylprednisolone.
                
It may take a few months to notice the effects of these medicines. Most often, as blood cell counts rise, symptoms lessen. Blood cell counts in people who respond well to these medicines usually don't reach normal levels. However, the blood cell counts often are high enough to allow people to do their normal activities.
                
People who have aplastic anemia may need long-term treatment with these medicines.
                
Medicines that suppress the immune system can have side effects. They also may increase the risk of developing leukemia (lu-KE-me-ah) or myelodysplasia (MI-e-lo-dis-PLA-ze-ah; MDS). Leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells. MDS is a condition in which the bone marrow makes too many faulty blood cells.
                
Medicines To Prevent and Treat Infections

                    There are different types of treatment for children with Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    Different types of treatment are available for children with Hodgkin lymphoma. Some treatments are standard and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Medical oncologist /hematologist.    -  Pediatric surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Endocrinologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Social worker.    -  Child-life specialist.        The treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma in adolescents and young adults may be different than the treatment for children. Some adolescents and young adults are treated with an adult treatment regimen.
                
                
                    Children and adolescents may have treatment-related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    Some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended. These are called late effects. Because late effects affect health and development, regular follow-up exams are important.   Late effects of cancer treatment may include:         - Physical problems that affect the following:               - Development of sex and reproductive organs.      -  Fertility (ability to have children).      - Bone and muscle growth and development.      -  Thyroid, heart, or lung function.      - Teeth, gums, and salivary gland function.      -  Spleen function (increased risk of infection).              - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).         For female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, there is an increased risk of breast cancer. This risk depends on the amount of radiation therapy they received to the breast during treatment and the chemotherapy regimen used. The risk of breast cancer is decreased if these female survivors also received radiation therapy to the ovaries.    It is suggested that female survivors who received radiation therapy to the breast have a mammogram once a year starting 8 years after treatment or at age 25 years, whichever is later. Female survivors of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma who have breast cancer have an increased risk of dying from the disease compared to patients with no history of Hodgkin lymphoma who have breast cancer.   Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the risk group. For example, children with low-risk Hodgkin lymphoma receive fewer cycles of treatment, fewer anticancer drugs, and lower doses of anticancer drugs than children with high-risk lymphoma.    See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor.       -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           Radiation therapy may be given, based on the childs risk group and chemotherapy regimen. External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. The radiation is given only to the lymph nodes or other areas with cancer. Internal radiation therapy is not used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy and proteasome inhibitor therapy are being used in the treatment of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.     In children, rituximab may be used to treat refractory or recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied to treat children.    Proteasome inhibitor therapy is a type of targeted therapy that blocks the action of proteasomes (proteins that remove other proteins the body no longer needs) in cancer cells and may prevent the growth of tumors. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat refractory or recurrent childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.        Surgery     Surgery may be done to remove as much of the tumor as possible for localized nodular lymphocyte -predominant childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.       High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant      High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.    See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Proton beam radiation therapy     Proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small, positively-charged particles of matter) to make radiation. This type of radiation therapy may help lessen the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   For patients who receive chemotherapy alone, a PET scan may be done 3 weeks or more after treatment ends. For patients who receive radiation therapy last, a PET scan should not be done until 8 to 12 weeks after treatment.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Hereditary lymphedema type II ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Hereditary lymphedema type II? Hereditary lymphedema type II is characterized by the abnormal transport of lymph fluid. This causes the lymph fluid to build up, causing swelling (lymphedema). Individuals with hereditary lymphedema type II usually develop swelling in the lower legs and feet during puberty. Some affected individuals develop a non-contagious skin infection called cellulitis, which can further damage the lymphatic vessels (the thin tubes that carry lymph fluid).    The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hereditary lymphedema type II. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

genetic changes,"What are the genetic changes related to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes ?","MELAS can result from mutations in one of several genes, including MT-ND1, MT-ND5, MT-TH, MT-TL1, and MT-TV. These genes are found in the DNA of cellular structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA.  Some of the genes related to MELAS provide instructions for making proteins involved in normal mitochondrial function. These proteins are part of a large enzyme complex in mitochondria that helps convert oxygen, fats, and simple sugars to energy. Other genes associated with this disorder provide instructions for making molecules called transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which are chemical cousins of DNA. These molecules help assemble protein building blocks called amino acids into full-length, functioning proteins within mitochondria.  Mutations in a particular transfer RNA gene, MT-TL1, cause more than 80 percent of all cases of MELAS. These mutations impair the ability of mitochondria to make proteins, use oxygen, and produce energy. Researchers have not determined how changes in mtDNA lead to the specific signs and symptoms of MELAS. They continue to investigate the effects of mitochondrial gene mutations in different tissues, particularly in the brain.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""MELAS"", ""full_form"": ""mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to MELAS ?,"What are the genetic changes related to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes ?",8,"[[""Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy Lactic Acidosis and Stroke"", ""Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy Lactic Acidosis and Strokelike"", ""Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy Lactic Acidosis Stroke"", ""Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis and Stroke"", ""Myopathy Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis and Stroke"", ""Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes"", ""Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes"", ""Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-Like Episodes"", ""Myoclonus Epilepsy Lactic Acidosis Stroke"", ""Myoclonus Epilepsy Lactic Acidosis Stroke"", ""Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-Like Episodes""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

outlook,What is the outlook for Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma) ?,"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - Whether the cancer is in the upper or lower part of the bile duct system.     - The stage of the cancer (whether it affects only the bile ducts or has spread to the liver, lymph nodes, or other places in the body).    - Whether the cancer has spread to nearby nerves or veins.    - Whether the cancer can be completely removed by surgery.    - Whether the patient has other conditions, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis.    - Whether the level of CA 19-9 is higher than normal.    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).        Treatment options may also depend on the symptoms caused by the cancer. Bile duct cancer is usually found after it has spread and can rarely be completely removed by surgery. Palliative therapy may relieve symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""BDC"", ""full_form"": ""Bile Duct Cancer""}, {""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CCA"", ""full_form"": ""Cholangiocarcinoma""}]}",What is the outlook for BDC (CCA) ?,What is the outlook for Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma) ?,3,"[[""Backup Domain Controller"", ""Business Development Corporation"", ""Bottom Dead Center"", ""Business Development Council"", ""Baltimore Development Corporation"", ""Batch Data Communication"", ""Big Daddy Cool"", ""Banco Di Chiavari"", ""Bubba Da Cat"", ""Big Dot Com""], [""Chromated Copper Arsenate"", ""Corrections Corporation of America"", ""Co Curricular Activities"", ""Capital Cost Allowance"", ""Centre for Contemporary Arts"", ""Certified Crop Adviser"", ""Chosen Ciphertext Attack"", ""Circuit Card Assembly"", ""Collie Club of America"", ""Computer Club Across""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""], [""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Business Development Company"", ""Carbon Capture and Storage""]","Analytical/Evaluative (Convergent Thinking): This merged category is for queries that involve dissecting complex information or data to understand underlying patterns, reasons, or to make informed judgements.

considerations,What to do for Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome ?,"- Cyclic vomiting syndrome, sometimes referred to as CVS, is an increasingly recognized disorder with sudden, repeated attacksalso called episodesof severe nausea, vomiting, and physical exhaustion that occur with no apparent cause.  - The disorder can affect a person for months, years, or decades.  - The cause of cyclic vomiting syndrome is unknown.  - The severe vomiting and retching that define cyclic vomiting syndrome increase the chance of developing several complications, including dehydration, esophagitis, a Mallory-Weiss tear, and tooth decay.  - Intensity of symptoms will vary as a person cycles through four distinct phases of an episode.  - The main symptoms of cyclic vomiting syndrome are severe nausea and sudden vomiting lasting hours to days.  - People with cyclic vomiting syndrome should get plenty of rest and take medications to prevent a vomiting episode, stop an episode in progress, speed up recovery, or relieve associated symptoms.  - During the well phase, a balanced diet and regular meals are important. A health care provider will assist with planning a return to a regular diet.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CVS"", ""full_form"": ""Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome""}]}",What to do for CVS ?,What to do for Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome ?,8,"[[""CVS Corporation"", ""Chorionic Villus Sampling"", ""Concurrent Version System"", ""Council for Voluntary Service"", ""Council for Voluntary Services"", ""Concurrent Versioning System"", ""cardiovascular system"", ""Chorionic Villi Sampling"", ""Consumer Value Stores"", ""Code Versioning System""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Cardiovascular System""]","Instructional: Queries specifically seeking step-by-step guidance, instructions, or procedures to perform a task. it focuses on 'how' to do something rather than 'what', 'why', or 'which'.",[1.2439235210357687e-12],[2.360768994700287e-07],"[""cardiovascular system""]",[2.360768994700287e-07],"[""ABBREVIATIONS""]","[[2.0591377004377928e-11, 2.0579590738894254e-21, 3.154978244410874e-14, 6.75988541215181e-16, 2.1172746704857705e-14, 6.3445311700948554e-18, 2.360768994700287e-07, 9.070056026207505e-20, 1.2577426316691132e-17, 7.102898489348903e-20]]",[0.7988190057289084],[0.8045119037225159],"[""Concurrent Versioning System""]",[0.812509751892911],"[""ABBREVIATIONS""]","[[0.8093365035241045, 0.6718108820299478, 0.6645027104877603, 0.6529632438705949, 0.6565344271721338, 0.6605302230651444, 0.812509751892911, 0.6750361302596495, 0.7704625543959587, 0.6881739834727562]]","[""cardiovascular system""]","[""ABBREVIATIONS""]",What to do for CVS (Concurrent Versioning System) ?,[false],[true],[true],"[""For maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system, it is important to follow a balanced diet, engage in regular physical activity, avoid smoking, manage stress, and get regular check-ups with a healthcare provider.""]","[""For Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome, it is important to work with a healthcare provider to develop a treatment plan.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to pulmonary arterial hypertension ?,"Mutations in the BMPR2 gene are the most common genetic cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension. This gene plays a role in regulating the number of cells in certain tissues. Researchers suggest that a mutation in this gene promotes cell division or prevents cell death, resulting in an overgrowth of cells in small arteries throughout the lungs. As a result, these arteries narrow in diameter, which increases the resistance to blood flow. Blood pressure in the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle of the heart increases to overcome the increased resistance to blood flow.  Mutations in several additional genes have also been found to cause pulmonary arterial hypertension, but they are much less common causes of the disorder than are BMPR2 gene mutations. Variations in other genes may increase the risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension or modify the course of the disease (usually making it more severe). Changes in as-yet-unidentified genes may also be associated with this condition.  Although pulmonary arterial hypertension often occurs on its own, it can also be part of syndromes that affect many parts of the body. For example, this condition is occasionally found in people with systemic scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, critical congenital heart disease, or Down syndrome.  Researchers have also identified nongenetic factors that increase the risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension.

causes,What causes Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome ?,"While idiopathic, or unknown, diseases are the most common cause of primary childhood nephrotic syndrome, researchers have linked certain diseases and some specific genetic changes that damage the kidneys with primary childhood nephrotic syndrome.
                
The cause of secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome is an underlying disease or infection. Called a primary illness, its this underlying disease or infection that causes changes in the kidney function that can result in secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome.
                
Congenital diseasesdiseases that are present at birthcan also cause childhood nephrotic syndrome.
                
Primary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome
                
The following diseases are different types of idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome:
                
- Minimal change disease involves damage to the glomeruli that can be seen only with an electron microscope. This type of microscope shows tiny details better than any other microscope. Scientists do not know the exact cause of minimal change disease. Minimal change disease is the most common cause of idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome.1  - Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is scarring in scattered regions of the kidney:     - Focal means that only some of the glomeruli become scarred.    - Segmental means damage affects only part of an individual glomerulus.    - Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a group of disorders involving deposits of antibodies that build up in the glomeruli, causing thickening and damage. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to protect the body from foreign substances such as bacteria or viruses.
                
Secondary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome
                
Some common diseases that can cause secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome include
                
- diabetes, a condition that occurs when the body cannot use glucosea type of sugarnormally  - Henoch-Schnlein purpura, a disease that causes small blood vessels in the body to become inflamed and leak  - hepatitis, inflammation of the liver caused by a virus  - human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a virus that alters the immune system  - lupus, an autoimmune disease that occurs when the body attacks its own immune system  - malaria, a disease of the blood that is spread by mosquitos  - streptococcal infection, an infection that results when the bacteria that causes strep throat or a skin infection is left untreated
                
Other causes of secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome can include certain medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and exposure to chemicals, such as mercury and lithium.
                
Congenital Diseases and Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome
                
Congenital nephrotic syndrome is rare and affects infants in the first 3 months of life.2 This type of nephrotic syndrome, sometimes called infantile nephrotic syndrome, can be caused by
                
- inherited genetic defects, which are problems passed from parent to child through genes  - infections at the time of birth
                
More information about underlying diseases or infections that cause changes in kidney function is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Glomerular Diseases.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CNS"", ""full_form"": ""Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome""}]}",What causes CNS ?,What causes Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome ?,8,"[[""Central nervous system"", ""Clinical Nurse Specialist"", ""Cybercast News Service"", ""College of Natural Sciences"", ""Communications, Navigation and Surveillance"", ""Computing and Network Services"", ""Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus"", ""Continuous Net Settlement"", ""Corporation for National Service"", ""Certified Novell Salesperson""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Central Nervous System""]","Analytical/Evaluative (Convergent Thinking): This merged category is for queries that involve dissecting complex information or data to understand underlying patterns, reasons, or to make informed judgements.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Amyotonia congenita ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Amyotonia congenita? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Amyotonia congenita. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Skeletal muscle atrophy - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""AC"", ""full_form"": ""Amyotonia congenita""}]}",What are the symptoms of AC ?,What are the symptoms of Amyotonia congenita ?,8,"[[""Acute"", ""AirCraft"", ""Air Conditioning"", ""Alternating Current"", ""Air Conditioner"", ""Access Control"", ""Atlantic City"", ""Air Cooled"", ""Advisory Committee"", ""Area Code""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Anterior Cervical""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to familial exudative vitreoretinopathy ?,"Mutations in the FZD4, LRP5, and NDP genes can cause familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that participate in a chemical signaling pathway that affects the way cells and tissues develop. In particular, the proteins produced from the FZD4, LRP5, and NDP genes appear to play critical roles in the specialization of retinal cells and the establishment of a blood supply to the retina and the inner ear. The LRP5 protein also helps regulate bone formation.  Mutations in the FZD4, LRP5, or NDP gene disrupt chemical signaling during early development, which interferes with the formation of blood vessels at the edges of the retina. The resulting abnormal blood supply to this tissue leads to retinal damage and vision loss in some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy.  The eye abnormalities associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy tend to be similar no matter which gene is altered. However, affected individuals with LRP5 gene mutations often have reduced bone mineral density in addition to vision loss. Mutations in the other genes responsible for familial exudative vitreoretinopathy do not appear to affect bone density.  In some cases, the cause of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is unknown. Researchers believe that mutations in several as-yet-unidentified genes are responsible for the disorder in these cases.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""FEVR"", ""full_form"": ""familial exudative vitreoretinopathy""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to FEVR ?,What are the genetic changes related to familial exudative vitreoretinopathy ?,8,"[[""Federation Europeenne des Victimes de la Route"", ""Fremont and Elkhorn Valley Railroad"", ""Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy"", ""Familial Exudative Vitreal Retinopathy (ophthalmological malady of the vitreous and retina)"", ""F&#233;d&#233;ration Europ&#233;enne des Victimes de la Route (French: European Federation of Road Traffic Victims)"", ""Fremont &amp; Elkhorn Valley Railroad"", ""Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy"", ""Fremont & Elkhorn Valley Railroad"", ""Familial Exudative Vitreal Retinopathy (ophthalmological malady of the vitreous and retina)"", ""F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Europ\u00e9enne des Victimes de la Route (French: European Federation of Road Traffic Victims)""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

The diagnosis can also be confirmed by genetic testing.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""MCAD"", ""full_form"": ""Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase""}]}",How to diagnose MCAD deficiency ?,How to diagnose Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency ?,8,"[[""Microsoft Certified Application Developer"", ""Mechanical Computer-Aided Design"", ""Microsoft Certified Applications Developer"", ""Medium Chain Acylcoa Dehydrogenase"", ""Medium Chain Absorption Deficiency"", ""Minneapolis College of Art and Design"", ""Mechanical Computer Aided Design"", ""mechanical Computer Assisted Design"", ""Miami Center for Architecture and Design"", ""Museums and Cultural Affairs Department""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Medium-Chain Acyl-Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase Deficiency""]","Instructional: Queries specifically seeking step-by-step guidance, instructions, or procedures to perform a task. it focuses on 'how' to do something rather than 'what', 'why', or 'which'.",[2.7628871749623696e-41],[6.209642458097067e-46],"[""Medium Chain Absorption Deficiency""]",[1.8413543193607053e-16],"[""ABBREVIATIONS""]","[[2.993180166775642e-28, 7.155777909318381e-19, 2.2636952403168613e-28, 6.814321577157594e-33, 1.8413543193607053e-16, 2.867390326881172e-33, 1.9686625161954228e-17, 9.030624633432749e-17, 5.520990326759908e-26, 1.3910725514287196e-21]]",[0.9356296023047643],[0.9281834514709509],"[""Museums and Cultural Affairs Department""]",[0.9281834514709509],"[""LLM""]","[[0.6558750993491713, 0.858030199407724, 0.6480568867770244, 0.9277761205165972, 0.9229217046071674, 0.9120327430047536, 0.8170730763929162, 0.8761204554201144, 0.9201447374199356, 0.9046235826012481]]","[""Medium Chain Acylcoa Dehydrogenase""]","[""ABBREVIATIONS""]",How to diagnose MCAD (Museums and Cultural Affairs Department) deficiency ?,[true],[true],[true],"[""Diagnosing MCAD deficiency involves blood tests to measure levels of acylcarnitines and genetic testing to identify mutations in the ACADM gene.""]","[""Diagnosis of Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency involves blood tests to measure levels of specific fatty acids and acylcarnitines, genetic testing to identify mutations in the ACADM gene, and urine tests to detect abnormal metabolites.""]","[""Diagnosing MCAD deficiency involves blood tests to measure levels of acylcarnitines and genetic testing to identify mutations in the ACADM gene.""]",[true],[true],[true],"[""Diagnosing MCAD deficiency involves blood tests to measure levels of fatty acids and acylcarnitines, as well as genetic testing to identify mutations in the ACADM gene.""]","[""Diagnosis of Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency involves blood tests to measure levels of specific fatty acids and acylcarnitines, genetic testing to identify mutations in the ACADM gene, and urine tests to detect abnormal metabolites.""]","[""Diagnosing MCAD deficiency involves blood tests to measure levels of certain enzymes and genetic testing to identify mutations in the ACADM gene.""]",[true],[true],[true],"[""Diagnosing MCAD deficiency involves blood tests to measure levels of acylcarnitines and genetic testing to identify mutations in the ACADM gene.""]","[""Diagnosing Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency involves blood tests to measure levels of specific fatty acids and acylcarnitines, genetic testing to identify mutations in the ACADM gene, and urine tests to detect abnormal metabolites.""]","[""Diagnosing MCAD deficiency involves blood tests to measure levels of acylcarnitines and genetic testing for mutations in the ACADM gene.""]",[true],[true],[true],"[""Diagnosing MCAD deficiency involves genetic testing to identify mutations in the ACADM gene, blood tests to measure levels of specific fatty acids, and urine tests to detect abnormal metabolites.""]","[""Diagnosing Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency involves blood tests to measure levels of acylcarnitines and genetic testing to identify mutations in the ACADM gene.""]","[""Diagnosing MCAD deficiency involves blood tests to measure levels of acylcarnitines and genetic testing to identify mutations in the ACADM gene.""]",[true],[true],[true],"[""Diagnosis of MCAD deficiency is typically done through newborn screening tests, which involve measuring the levels of specific enzymes in the blood.

information,Do you have information about HIV/AIDS in Women,"Summary : HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, kills or damages cells of the body's immune system. The most advanced stage of infection with HIV is AIDS, which stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.     HIV often spreads through unprotected sex with an infected person. It may also spread by sharing drug needles or through contact with the blood of an infected person.    Women can get HIV more easily during vaginal sex than men can. And if they do get HIV, they have unique problems, including:       - Complications such as repeated vaginal yeast infections, severe pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and a higher risk of cervical cancer    - Different side effects from the drugs that treat HIV    - The risk of giving HIV to their baby while pregnant or during childbirth       There is no cure, but there are many medicines to fight both HIV infection and the infections and cancers that come with it.

treatment,What are the treatments for Mitral Valve Prolapse ?,"Most people who have mitral valve prolapse (MVP) dont need treatment because they dont have symptoms and complications.
                
Even people who do have symptoms may not need treatment. The presence of symptoms doesnt always mean that the backflow of blood through the valve is significant.
                
People who have MVP and troublesome mitral valve backflow may be treated with medicines, surgery, or both.
                
The goals of treating MVP include:
                
Correcting the underlying mitral valve problem, if necessary
                
Preventinginfective endocarditis,arrhythmias, and other complications
                
Relieving symptoms
                
Medicines
                
Medicines called beta blockers may be used to treatpalpitationsand chest discomfort in people who have little or no mitral valve backflow.
                
If you have significant backflow and symptoms, your doctor may prescribe:
                
Blood-thinning medicines to reduce the risk of blood clots forming if you haveatrial fibrillation.
                
Digoxin to strengthen your heartbeat.
                
Diuretics (fluidpills) to remove excess sodium and fluid in your body and lungs.
                
Medicines such as flecainide and procainamide to regulate your heart rhythms.
                
Vasodilators to widen your blood vessels and reduce your hearts workload. Examples of vasodilators are isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine.
                
Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.
                
Surgery
                
Surgery is done only if the mitral valve is very abnormal and blood is flowing back into the atrium. The main goal of surgery is to improve symptoms and reduce the risk ofheart failure.
                
The timing of the surgery is important. If its done too early and your leaking valve is working fairly well, you may be put at needless risk from surgery. If its done too late, you may have heart damage that can't be fixed.
                
Surgical Approaches
                
Traditionally, heart surgeons repair or replace a mitral valve by making an incision (cut) in the breastbone and exposing the heart.
                
A small but growing number of surgeons are using another approach that involves one or more small cuts through the side of the chest wall. This results in less cutting, reduced blood loss, and a shorter hospital stay. However, not all hospitals offer this method.
                
Valve Repair and Valve Replacement
                
In mitral valve surgery, the valve is repaired or replaced. Valve repair is preferred when possible. Repair is less likely than replacement to weaken the heart. Repair also lowers the risk of infection and decreases the need for lifelong use of blood-thinning medicines.
                
If repair isnt an option, the valve can be replaced. Mechanical and biological valves are used as replacement valves.
                
Mechanical valves are man-made and can last a lifetime. People who have mechanical valves must take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of their lives.
                
Biological valves are taken from cows or pigs or made from human tissue. Many people who have biological valves dont need to take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of their lives. The major drawback of biological valves is that they weaken over time and often last only about 10 years.
                
After surgery, youll likely stay in the hospitals intensive care unit for 2 to 3 days. Overall, most people who have mitral valve surgery spend about 1 to 2 weeks in the hospital. Complete recovery takes a few weeks to several months, depending on your health before surgery.
                
If youve had valve repair or replacement, you may need antibiotics before dental work and surgery. These procedures can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream. Antibiotics can help prevent infective endocarditis, a serious heart valve infection. Discuss with your doctor whether you need to take antibiotics before such procedures.
                
Transcatheter Valve Therapy
                
Interventional cardiologists may be able to repair leaky mitral valves by implanting a device using a catheter (tube) inserted through a large blood vessel. This approach is less invasive and can prevent a person from havingopen-heart surgery. At present, the device is only approved for people with severe mitral regurgitation who cannot undergo surgery.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""MVP"", ""full_form"": ""Mitral Valve Prolapse""}]}",What are the treatments for MVP ?,What are the treatments for Mitral Valve Prolapse ?,8,"[[""Most Valuable Player"", ""Most Valuable Professional"", ""Mitral Valve Prolapse"", ""Most Valuable Primate"", ""Most Valued Professional"", ""Music And Video Player"", ""Music Video Player"", ""MindSolve Visual Performance"", ""Most Valuable Performer"", ""Music Video Pictures""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Mitral Valve Prolapse""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal pyramidal signs 90% Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function 90% Behavioral abnormality 90% Developmental regression 90% Incoordination 90% Involuntary movements 90% Seizures 90% Retinopathy 7.5% Visual impairment 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom.

complications,What are the complications of Crohn's Disease ?,"Complications of Crohn's disease can include
                
- bowel obstruction. Crohn's disease can thicken the wall of the intestine. Over time, the thickened areas of the intestine can narrow, which can block the intestine. A partial or complete obstruction, also called a bowel blockage, can block the movement of food or stool through the intestines. A complete bowel obstruction is life threatening and requires immediate medical attention and often surgery.  - fistulasabnormal passages, or tunnels, between two organs, or between an organ and the outside of the body. How a health care provider treats fistulas depends on their type and severity. For some people, fistulas heal with medication and diet changes, while other people will need to have surgery.  - anal fissuressmall tears in the anus that may cause itching, pain, or bleeding. Most anal fissures heal with medical treatment, including ointments, warm baths, and dietary changes.  - ulcers. Inflammation anywhere along the GI tract can lead to ulcers or open sores in a person's mouth, intestines, anus, and perineumthe area between the anus and the sex organs. In most cases, the treatment a health care provider prescribes for Crohn's disease will also treat the ulcers.  - malnutritiona condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. Some people may need IV fluids or feeding tubes to replace lost nutrients and fluids.  - inflammation in other areas of the body. The immune system can trigger inflammation in the      - joints    - eyes    - skin
                
Health care providers can treat inflammation by adjusting medications or prescribing new medications.
                

                
Crohn's Disease and Colon Cancer   People with Crohn's disease in the large intestine may be more likely to develop colon cancer. People who receive ongoing treatment and remain in remission may reduce their chances of developing colon cancer.   People with Crohn's disease should talk with their health care provider about how often they should get screened for colon cancer. Screening can include colonoscopy with biopsies. Such screening does not reduce a person's chances of developing colon cancer. Instead, screening can help diagnose cancer early and improve chances for recovery.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CD"", ""full_form"": ""Crohn's Disease""}]}",What are the complications of CD ?,What are the complications of Crohn's Disease ?,8,"[[""Compact Disc"", ""Compact Disc - Music, software programs and digital media"", ""Celine Dion"", ""Cadmium"", ""Christian Dior"", ""Canadian Dollar"", ""Compact Disk"", ""Cardiovascular Disease"", ""Compact Disk description"", ""Compact Design""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Crohn's Disease""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

susceptibility,Who is at risk for Iron-Deficiency Anemia? ?,"Infants and Young Children
                
Infants and young children need a lot of iron to grow and develop. The iron that full-term infants have stored in their bodies is used up in the first 4 to 6 months of life.
                
Premature and low-birth-weight babies (weighing less than 5.5 pounds) are at even greater risk for iron-deficiency anemia. These babies don't have as much iron stored in their bodies as larger, full-term infants.
                
Iron-fortified baby food or iron supplements, when used properly, can help prevent iron-deficiency anemia in infants and young children. Talk with your child's doctor about your child's diet.
                
Young children who drink a lot of cow's milk may be at risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Milk is low in iron, and too much milk may take the place of iron-rich foods in the diet. Too much milk also may prevent children's bodies from absorbing iron from other foods.
                
Children who have lead in their blood also may be at risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Lead can interfere with the body's ability to make hemoglobin. Lead may get into the body from breathing in lead dust, eating lead in paint or soil, or drinking water that contains lead.
                
Teens
                
Teens are at risk for iron-deficiency anemia if they're underweight or have chronic (ongoing) illnesses. Teenage girls who have heavy periods also are at increased risk for the condition.
                
Women
                
Women of childbearing age are at higher risk for iron-deficiency anemia because of blood loss during their monthly periods. About 1 in 5 women of childbearing age has iron-deficiency anemia.
                
Pregnant women also are at higher risk for the condition because they need twice as much iron as usual. The extra iron is needed for increased blood volume and for the fetus' growth.
                
About half of all pregnant women develop iron-deficiency anemia. The condition can increase a pregnant woman's risk for a premature or low-birth-weight baby.
                
Adults Who Have Internal Bleeding
                
Adults who have internal bleeding, such as intestinal bleeding, can develop iron-deficiency anemia due to blood loss. Certain conditions, such as colon cancer and bleeding ulcers, can cause blood loss. Some medicines, such as aspirin, also can cause internal bleeding.
                
Other At-Risk Groups
                
People who get kidney dialysis treatment may develop iron-deficiency anemia. This is because blood is lost during dialysis. Also, the kidneys are no longer able to make enough of a hormone that the body needs to produce red blood cells.
                
People who have gastric bypass surgery also may develop iron-deficiency anemia. This type of surgery can prevent the body from absorbing enough iron.
                
Certain eating patterns or habits may put you at higher risk for iron-deficiency anemia. This can happen if you:
                
Follow a diet that excludes meat and fish, which are the best sources of iron. However, vegetarian diets can provide enough iron if you eat the right foods. For example, good nonmeat sources of iron include iron-fortified breads and cereals, beans, tofu, dried fruits, and spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables.
                
Eat poorly because of money, social, health, or other problems.
                
Follow a very low-fat diet over a long time. Some higher fat foods, like meat, are the best sources of iron.
                
Follow a high-fiber diet. Large amounts of fiber can slow the absorption of iron.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""IDA"", ""full_form"": ""Iron-Deficiency Anemia""}]}",Who is at risk for IDA? ?,Who is at risk for Iron-Deficiency Anemia? ?,8,"[[""International Development Association"", ""Institute for Defense Analyses"", ""Industrial Development Agency"", ""Individual Development Account"", ""Investment Dealers Association"", ""Iron Deficiency Anemia"", ""In Defense of Animals"", ""IdaCorp, Inc."", ""Instituto de Desarrollo Agrario"", ""Institute for Defense Analysis""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Iron Deficiency Anemia""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with hoarseness ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with hoarseness? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with hoarseness. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Onion bulb formation 7.5% Areflexia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Axonal degeneration/regeneration - Decreased motor nerve conduction velocity - Decreased number of peripheral myelinated nerve fibers - Distal amyotrophy - Distal muscle weakness - Distal sensory impairment - Flexion contracture - Neonatal onset - Pes cavus - Spinal deformities - Split hand - Vocal cord paresis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CMT"", ""full_form"": ""Charcot-Marie-Tooth""}]}",What are the symptoms of Autosomal recessive CMT disease with hoarseness ?,What are the symptoms of Autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with hoarseness ?,8,"[[""Country Music Television"", ""Charcot Marie Tooth"", ""Constant Maturity Treasury"", ""Certified Massage Therapist"", ""California Mastitis Test"", ""Chartered Market Technician"", ""Certified Medical Transcriptionist"", ""Cut, Make, and Trim"", ""Caravan Motor Touristik"", ""Carlsberg Meridian Telescope""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Charcot-Marie-Tooth""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

information,Do you have information about HPV,"Summary : Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are common viruses that can cause warts. There are more than 100 types of HPV. Most are harmless, but about 30 types put you at risk for cancer. These types affect the genitals and you get them through sexual contact with an infected partner. They can be either low-risk or high-risk. Low-risk HPV can cause genital warts. High-risk HPV can lead to cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, and anus in women. In men, it can lead to cancers of the anus and penis.    Although some people develop genital warts from HPV infection, others have no symptoms. Your health care provider can treat or remove the warts. In women, Pap tests can detect changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer. Both Pap and HPV tests are types of cervical cancer screening.    Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HPV. Vaccines can protect against several types of HPV, including some that can cause cancer.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Spastic paraplegia 26 ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Spastic paraplegia 26? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spastic paraplegia 26. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cataract 5% Decreased serum testosterone level 5% Nystagmus 5% Urinary urgency 5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Babinski sign - Cerebral cortical atrophy - Difficulty walking - Distal amyotrophy - Dysarthria - Dyskinesia - Dysmetria - Dystonia - Emotional lability - Frequent falls - Hyperreflexia - Intellectual disability, mild - Lower limb spasticity - Pes cavus - Progressive - Scoliosis - Slow progression - Spastic gait - Spastic paraplegia - Toe walking - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""SPG26"", ""full_form"": ""Spastic paraplegia 26""}]}",What are the symptoms of SPG26 ?,What are the symptoms of Spastic paraplegia 26 ?,8,[[]],[[]],"[""Spastic Paraplegia 26""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis? Signs and symptoms of juvenile ALS vary but include slowly to very slowly progressive muscle weakness, increased muscle tone, Babinski reflex, muscle spasm (clonus), exaggerated reflexes, muscle wasting, and muscle twitching. Juvenile ALS usually does not affect thinking or mental processing, nor does it tend to cause sensory dysfunction (e.g., numbness or tingling). As the condition progresses muscle involvement can be severe. Some people with juvenile ALS, eventually experience muscle weakness in the face and throat. Some have experienced emotional liability (involuntary crying or laughing) and/or respiratory weakness.[133]","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""ALS"", ""full_form"": ""amyotrophic lateral sclerosis""}]}",What are the symptoms of Juvenile ALS ?,What are the symptoms of Juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ?,8,"[[""Appraisal & Liquidation Services, Incorporated"", ""Appraisal & Liquidation Services"", ""Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"", ""Alstom"", ""Advanced Life Support"", ""Advanced Light Source"", ""Aldolase"", ""Ambient Light Sensor"", ""Autograph Letter Signed"", ""Administrative License Suspension""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

inheritance,Is atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome inherited ?,"Most cases of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome are sporadic, which means that they occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. Less than 20 percent of all cases have been reported to run in families. When the disorder is familial, it can have an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.  Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. However, most people with the autosomal dominant form of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome have no history of the disorder in their family. Because not everyone who inherits a gene mutation will develop the signs and symptoms of the disease, an affected individual may have unaffected relatives who carry a copy of the mutation.

treatment,What are the treatments for Acute intermittent porphyria ?,"How might acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) be treated? Treatment of AIP may vary based on the trigger of the attack and the symptoms present. Treatment may include stopping medications that cause or worsen the symptoms, treating any infections which may be present, administration of pain medication, monitoring fluid balance and/or correcting electrolyte disturbances, monitoring neurologic status and administering respiratory support. Mild attacks can be manged with increased caloric intake and fluid replacement. Recurrent acute attacks should be managed by a porphyria specialist. Hospitalization is often necessary.  Panhematin, an intravenous medication used to correct heme deficiency, may also be prescribed. More detailed information about the use of Panhematin for the treatment of AIP can be found by clicking here.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""AIP"", ""full_form"": ""Acute intermittent porphyria""}]}",What are the treatments for AIP ?,What are the treatments for Acute intermittent porphyria ?,8,"[[""American Institute of Physics"", ""Airport Improvement Program"", ""Automatic Investment Plan"", ""Aeronautical Information Publication"", ""Agreement In Principle"", ""Air Independent Propulsion"", ""Atm Interface Processor"", ""Application Infrastructure Provider"", ""American Institute of Philanthropy"", ""American Israeli Paper Mills, LTD.""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Acute Intermittent Porphyria""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

The most common type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the United States is oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which accounts for about half of all cases. For reasons that are unclear, females seem to be affected with juvenile idiopathic arthritis somewhat more frequently than males. However, in enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis males are affected more often than females.

exams and tests,How to diagnose Fanconi Anemia ?,"People who have Fanconi anemia (FA) are born with the disorder. They may or may not show signs or symptoms of it at birth. For this reason, FA isn't always diagnosed when a person is born. In fact, most people who have the disorder are diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 15 years.
                
The tests used to diagnose FA depend on a person's age and symptoms. In all cases, medical and family histories are an important part of diagnosing FA. However, because FA has many of the same signs and symptoms as other diseases, only genetic testing can confirm its diagnosis.
                
Specialists Involved
                
A geneticist is a doctor or scientist who studies how genes work and how diseases and traits are passed from parents to children through genes.
                
Geneticists do genetic testing for FA. They also can provide counseling about how FA is inherited and the types of prenatal (before birth) testing used to diagnose it.
                
An obstetrician may detect birth defects linked to FA before your child is born. An obstetrician is a doctor who specializes in providing care for pregnant women.
                
After your child is born, a pediatrician also can help find out whether your child has FA. A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children and teens.
                
A hematologist (blood disease specialist) also may help diagnose FA.
                
Family and Medical Histories
                
FA is an inherited disease. Some parents are aware that their family has a medical history of FA, even if they don't have the disease.
                
Other parents, especially if they're FA carriers, may not be aware of a family history of FA. Many parents may not know that FA can be passed from parents to children.
                
Knowing your family medical history can help your doctor diagnose whether you or your child has FA or another condition with similar symptoms.
                
If your doctor thinks that you, your siblings, or your children have FA, he or she may ask you detailed questions about:
                
Any personal or family history of anemia
                
Any surgeries youve had related to the digestive system
                
Any personal or family history of immune disorders
                
Your appetite, eating habits, and any medicines you take
                
If you know your family has a history of FA, or if your answers to your doctor's questions suggest a possible diagnosis of FA, your doctor will recommend further testing.
                
Diagnostic Tests and Procedures
                
The signs and symptoms of FA aren't unique to the disease. They're also linked to many other diseases and conditions, such as aplastic anemia. For this reason, genetic testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis of FA. Genetic tests for FA include the following.
                
Chromosome Breakage Test
                
This is the most common test for FA. It's available only in special laboratories (labs). It shows whether your chromosomes (long chains of genes) break more easily than normal.
                
Skin cells sometimes are used for the test. Usually, though, a small amount of blood is taken from a vein in your arm using a needle. A technician combines some of the blood cells with certain chemicals.
                
If you have FA, the chromosomes in your blood sample break and rearrange when mixed with the test chemicals. This doesn't happen in the cells of people who don't have FA.
                
Cytometric Flow Analysis
                
Cytometric flow analysis, or CFA, is done in a lab. This test examines how chemicals affect your chromosomes as your cells grow and divide. Skin cells are used for this test.
                
A technician mixes the skin cells with chemicals that can cause the chromosomes in the cells to act abnormally. If you have FA, your cells are much more sensitive to these chemicals.
                
The chromosomes in your skin cells will break at a high rate during the test. This doesn't happen in the cells of people who don't have FA.
                
Mutation Screening
                
A mutation is an abnormal change in a gene or genes. Geneticists and other specialists can examine your genes, usually using a sample of your skin cells. With special equipment and lab processes, they can look for gene mutations that are linked to FA.
                
Diagnosing Different Age Groups
                
Before Birth (Prenatal)
                
If your family has a history of FA and you get pregnant, your doctor may want to test you or your fetus for FA.
                
Two tests can be used to diagnose FA in a developing fetus: amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). Both tests are done in a doctor's office or hospital.
                
Amniocentesis is done 15 to 18 weeks after a pregnant woman's last period. A doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of fluid from the sac around the fetus. A technician tests chromosomes (chains of genes) from the fluid sample to see whether they have faulty genes associated with FA.
                
CVS is done 10 to 12 weeks after a pregnant woman's last period. A doctor inserts a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta (the temporary organ that connects the fetus to the mother).
                
The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The tissue sample is sent to a lab to be tested for genetic defects associated with FA.
                
At Birth
                
Three out of four people who inherit FA are born with birth defects. If your baby is born with certain birth defects, your doctor may recommend genetic testing to confirm a diagnosis of FA.
                
For more information about these defects, go to What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Fanconi Anemia?
                
Childhood and Later
                
Some people who have FA are not born with birth defects. Doctors may not diagnose them with the disorder until signs of bone marrow failure or cancer occur. This usually happens within the first 10 years of life.
                
Signs of bone marrow failure most often begin between the ages of 3 and 12 years, with 7 to 8 years as the most common ages. However, 10 percent of children who have FA aren't diagnosed until after 16 years of age.
                
If your bone marrow is failing, you may have signs of aplastic anemia. FA is one type of aplastic anemia.
                
In aplastic anemia, your bone marrow stops making or doesn't make enough of all three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
                
Aplastic anemia can be inherited or acquired after birth through exposure to chemicals, radiation, or medicines.
                
Doctors diagnose aplastic anemia using:
                
Family and medical histories and a physical exam.
                
A complete blood count (CBC) to check the number, size, and condition of your red blood cells. The CBC also checks numbers of white blood cells and platelets.
                
A reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count. This test counts the number of new red blood cells in your blood to see whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the proper rate.
                
Bone marrow tests. For a bone marrow aspiration, a small amount of liquid bone marrow is removed and tested to see whether it's making enough blood cells. For a bone marrow biopsy, a small amount of bone marrow tissue is removed and tested to see whether it's making enough blood cells.
                
If you or your child is diagnosed with aplastic anemia, your doctor will want to find the cause. If your doctor suspects you have FA, he or she may recommend genetic testing.

treatment,What are the treatments for Acanthamoeba - Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis; Keratitis ?,"Early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis. Several prescription eye medications are available for treatment. However, the infection can be difficult to treat. The best treatment regimen for each patient should be determined by an eye doctor. If you suspect your eye may be infected with Acanthamoeba, see an eye doctor immediately.
    
Skin infections that are caused by Acanthamoeba but have not spread to the central nervous system can be successfully treated. Because this is a serious infection and the people affected typically have weakened immune systems, early diagnosis offers the best chance at cure.
    
Most cases of brain and spinal cord infection with Acanthamoeba (Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis) are fatal.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""GAE"", ""full_form"": ""Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis""}]}",What are the treatments for Acanthamoeba - GAE; Keratitis ?,What are the treatments for Acanthamoeba - Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis; Keratitis ?,0,"[[""Georgia Association of Educators"", ""Go Ahead Eagles"", ""Gaelic (Scots)"", ""Gabes, Tunisia"", ""Grupo Anticomunista Espa\u00f1ol"", ""Gallic Acid Equivalent"", ""Gallic Acid Equivalents"", ""Granulomatous Amoebic Encephalitis"", ""German Audio Engineering"", ""Google Apps Engine""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

susceptibility,Who is at risk for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia? ?,"Smoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation may affect the risk of adult AML. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Possible risk factors for AML include the following:         - Being male.    - Smoking, especially after age 60.    - Having had treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the past.    - Having had treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the past.    - Being exposed to radiation from an atomic bomb or to the chemical benzene.    - Having a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""AML"", ""full_form"": ""Acute Myeloid Leukemia""}]}",Who is at risk for Adult AML? ?,Who is at risk for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia? ?,8,"[[""Anti Money Laundering"", ""Acute Myelogenous Leukemia"", ""Acute Myeloid leukaemia"", ""Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia"", ""Abandoned Mine Lands"", ""Arc Macro Language"", ""Acute Monocytic Leukemia"", ""AMLI Residential Properties Trust"", ""A Major Label"", ""ACPI Machine Language""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Acute Myeloid Leukemia""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

causes,What causes Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ?,"What causes postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome? The underlying cause of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is poorly understood. However, episodes often begin after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness and may increase right before a menstrual period. Many researchers suspect that there may be more than one cause for the condition. The following abnormalities can be associated with POTS and may play a role in the development of the condition: Peripheral denervation - reduced nerve stimulation to certain muscles. The lower extremities are generally most affected in people with POTS. Hypovolemia - an abnormal decrease or redistribution of blood in the body Changes in venous function - more specifically, a reduction in the volume of blood that returns to the heart (venous return) when moving from a lying down to a standing position Cardiovascular deconditioning - changes in cardiovascular function Baroreflex abnormalities - the baroreflexes play an important role in blood pressure regulation. When they sense a change in blood pressure, the heart rate is adjusted and the sympathetic nerve system fibers are activated to cause the blood vessels to narrow. Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system Although most cases of POTS appear to occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition, some affected people report a family history of orthostatic intolerance (an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart when moving from a lying down to a standing position). This suggests that genetic factors may play a role in the development of POTS in some cases. Some studies also suggest that polymorphisms in certain genes (NOS3, ADRB2) may be associated with an increased risk of developing the condition and a change (mutation) in the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) has been identified in one family with POTS.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""POTS"", ""full_form"": ""Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome""}]}",What causes POTS ?,What causes Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ?,8,"[[""Plain Old Telephone Service"", ""Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome"", ""Plain Old Telephone Set"", ""Purchasing On-line Tracking System"", ""Parents Over The Shoulder"", ""Parting on the Square"", ""Poor Old Telephone System"", ""Part of the Solution"", ""Plain Old Time Sharing"", ""Perception of Teasing Scale""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the skin - Areflexia - Autoamputation (feet) - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Chronic axonal neuropathy - Decreased number of large peripheral myelinated nerve fibers - Decreased sensory nerve conduction velocity - Distal muscle weakness - Distal sensory impairment - Distal sensory loss of all modalities - Hyporeflexia - Osteomyelitis - Osteomyelitis or necrosis, distal, due to sensory neuropathy (feet) - Pes cavus - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Skeletal muscle atrophy - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""HSN1"", ""full_form"": ""Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1""}]}",What are the symptoms of HSN1 ?,What are the symptoms of Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 ?,8,"[[""Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy Type 1""]]","[[""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy Type 1""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

treatment,What are the treatments for Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome ?,"How might Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome be treated? Medications and therapies used to treat Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome may include anticholinesterase agents (e.g., Pyridostigmine), guanidine hydrochloride, plasmapheresis (where blood plasma is removed and replaced with fluid, protein, or donated plasma) or IV immunoglobulins, steroids (e.g., prednisone), azathioprine or cyclosporine, and/or 3,4-diaminopyridine. 3,4-diaminopyridine is available in Europe and may be available in the U.S. on a compassionate use basis. While there has been some evidence that either 3,4-diaminopyridine or IV immunoglobulin can improve muscle strength and nerve to muscle cell communication, the degree of benefit (i.e., how much symptoms are improved) still needs to be determined.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""LEMS"", ""full_form"": ""Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome""}]}",What are the treatments for LEMS ?,What are the treatments for Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome ?,8,"[[""Law Enforcement Message Switch"", ""Larchwood Emergency Medical Service"", ""Low Entropy Model Specification"", ""Laboratory Emissions Monitoring System"", ""Labour Export Management System"", ""Lake Elkhorn Middle School"", ""Law Enforcement Management System"", ""Local Energy Measurement Stations"", ""Low Energy Mass Spectrometry"", ""Lugoff Elgin Middle School""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

treatment,What are the treatments for Patent Ductus Arteriosus ?,"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is treated with medicines, catheter-based procedures, and surgery. The goal of treatment is to close the PDA. Closure will help prevent complications and reverse the effects of increased blood volume.
                
Small PDAs often close without treatment. For full-term infants, treatment is needed if the PDA is large or causing health problems. For premature infants, treatment is needed if the PDA is causing breathing problems or heart problems.
                
Talk with your child's doctor about treatment options and how your family prefers to handle treatment decisions.
                
Medicines
                
Your child's doctor may prescribe medicines to help close your child's PDA.
                
Indomethacin (in-doh-METH-ah-sin) is a medicine that helps close PDAs in premature infants. This medicine triggers the PDA to constrict or tighten, which closes the opening. Indomethacin usually doesn't work in full-term infants.
                
Ibuprofen also is used to close PDAs in premature infants. This medicine is similar to indomethacin.
                
Catheter-Based Procedures
                
Catheters are thin, flexible tubes that doctors use as part of a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). Catheter-based procedures often are used to close PDAs in infants or children who are large enough to have the procedure.
                
Your child's doctor may refer to the procedure as ""transcatheter device closure."" The procedure sometimes is used for small PDAs to prevent the risk of infective endocarditis (IE). IE is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves.
                
Your child will be given medicine to help him or her relax or sleep during the procedure. The doctor will insert a catheter in a large blood vessel in the groin (upper thigh). He or she will then guide the catheter to your child's heart.
                
A small metal coil or other blocking device is passed through the catheter and placed in the PDA. This device blocks blood flow through the vessel.
                
Catheter-based procedures don't require the child's chest to be opened. They also allow the child to recover quickly.
                
These procedures often are done on an outpatient basis. You'll most likely be able to take your child home the same day the procedure is done.
                
Complications from catheter-based procedures are rare and short term. They can include bleeding, infection, and movement of the blocking device from where it was placed.
                
Surgery
                
Surgery to correct a PDA may be done if:
                
A premature or full-term infant has health problems due to a PDA and is too small to have a catheter-based procedure
                
A catheter-based procedure doesn't successfully close the PDA
                
Surgery is planned for treatment of related congenital heart defects
                
Often, surgery isn't done until after 6 months of age in infants who don't have health problems from their PDAs. Doctors sometimes do surgery on small PDAs to prevent the risk of IE.
                
For the surgery, your child will be given medicine so that he or she will sleep and not feel any pain. The surgeon will make a small incision (cut) between your child's ribs to reach the PDA. He or she will close the PDA using stitches or clips.
                
Complications from surgery are rare and usually short term. They can include hoarseness, a paralyzed diaphragm (the muscle below the lungs), infection, bleeding, or fluid buildup around the lungs.
                
After Surgery
                
After surgery, your child will spend a few days in the hospital. He or she will be given medicine to reduce pain and anxiety. Most children go home 2 days after surgery. Premature infants usually have to stay in the hospital longer because of their other health issues.
                
The doctors and nurses at the hospital will teach you how to care for your child at home. They will talk to you about:
                
Limits on activity for your child while he or she recovers
                
Followup appointments with your child's doctors
                
How to give your child medicines at home, if needed
                
When your child goes home after surgery, you can expect that he or she will feel fairly comfortable. However, you child may have some short-term pain.
                
Your child should begin to eat better and gain weight quickly. Within a few weeks, he or she should fully recover and be able to take part in normal activities.
                
Long-term complications from surgery are rare. However, they can include narrowing of the aorta, incomplete closure of the PDA, and reopening of the PDA.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""PDA"", ""full_form"": ""Patent Ductus Arteriosus""}]}",What are the treatments for PDA ?,What are the treatments for Patent Ductus Arteriosus ?,8,"[[""Personal Digital Assistant"", ""Patent Ductus Arteriosus"", ""Personal Data Assistant"", ""Progressive Democrats of America"", ""Public Display of Affection"", ""Print Shop Bitmap Graphics"", ""Posterior Descending Artery"", ""Pennsylvania Dental Association"", ""Part Design Approval"", ""Pretty Darn Awesome""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Patent Ductus Arteriosus""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

susceptibility,Who is at risk for Kyasanur Forest Disease? ?,"KFD has historically been limited to the western and central districts of Karnataka State, India. However, in November 2012, samples from humans and monkeys tested positive for KFDV in the southernmost district of the State which neighbors Tamil Nadu State and Kerala State, indicating the possibility of wider distribution of KFDV. Additionally, a virus very similar to KFD virus (Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus) has been described in Saudi Arabia. 
                
People with recreational or occupational exposure to rural or outdoor settings (e.g., hunters, herders, forest workers, farmers) within Karnataka State are potentially at risk for infection by contact with infected ticks. Seasonality is another important risk factor as more cases are reported during the dry season, from November through June.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""KFD"", ""full_form"": ""Kyasanur Forest Disease""}]}",Who is at risk for KFD? ?,Who is at risk for Kyasanur Forest Disease? ?,8,"[[""Kinepolis Film Distribution"", ""Kentucky Fried Duck"", ""Kentucky Fried Deer"", ""Kyasanur Forest Disease"", ""Karnataka Forum for Dignity"", ""Kentucky Fried Dolphin"", ""Knowledge Fields Development"", ""Kikuchi Fujimoto Disease"", ""Kill Free Destroy"", ""Kyle Field Day""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Kyasanur Forest Disease""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""CODAS"", ""full_form"": ""Cerebral, Ocular, Dental, Auricular, Skeletal syndrome""}]}",What are the symptoms of CODAS syndrome ?,"What are the symptoms of Cerebral, Ocular, Dental, Auricular, Skeletal syndrome syndrome ?",8,"[[""Consolidated Operations and Delay Analysis System"", ""Common Oceanographic Data Access System"", ""Constrained Optimisation Design of Aerodynamic Shapes"", ""Color Optical Data Acquisition System"", ""Choronotehraputic Oral Drug Absorption System"", ""Common Ocean Data Access System"", ""Cause Of Death Analysis System"", ""Cerebro Oculo Dento Auriculo Skeletal"", ""Chronotherapeutic Oral Drug Absorption System"", ""Common Offset Distance Artificial Split""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Cerebro-Oculo-Dento-Auriculo-Skeletal syndrome""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

treatment,What are the treatments for Congenital adrenal hyperplasia ?,"How might congenital adrenal hyperplasia be treated? The best treatment options for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) depend on many factors including the type of CAH and the signs and symptoms present in each person. Many people with CAH require steroids to replace the low hormones. These medications will need to be taken daily throughout life or the symptoms of CAH may return. It is important that affected people on medications be closely followed by their healthcare provider because their dose may need to be adjusted at different times in life such as periods of high stress or illness. Girls with severe CAH who are born with ambiguous genitalia may undergo surgery to ensure proper function and/or to make the genitals look more female.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Progressive familial heart block type 1A ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Progressive familial heart block type 1A? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Progressive familial heart block type 1A. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Arrhythmia 50% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Complete heart block with broad RS complexes - Dyspnea - Heterogeneous - Left anterior fascicular block - Left postterior fascicular block - Right bundle branch block - Sudden cardiac death - Sudden death - Syncope - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""PFHBI"", ""full_form"": ""Progressive familial heart block type 1A""}]}",What are the symptoms of PFHBI ?,What are the symptoms of Progressive familial heart block type 1A ?,8,"[[""Progressive Familial Heart Block, Type I""]]","[[""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Percutaneous Fetal Heart Blood Injection""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy ?,"SAVI is caused by mutations in the TMEM173 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called STING, which is involved in immune system function. STING helps produce beta-interferon, a member of a class of proteins called cytokines that promote inflammation.  The TMEM173 gene mutations that cause SAVI are described as ""gain-of-function"" mutations because they enhance the activity of the STING protein, leading to overproduction of beta-interferon. Abnormally high beta-interferon levels cause excessive inflammation that results in tissue damage, leading to the signs and symptoms of SAVI.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""STING"", ""full_form"": ""Stimulator of Interferon Genes""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy ?,What are the genetic changes related to Stimulator of Interferon Genes-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy ?,8,"[[""Strike Team Investigative Narcotics Group"", ""Standing Together In the Name of God"", ""Serving The Interests and Needs of the Gifted"", ""Student Teachers Igniting the Next Generation"", ""Sustainable Technology in Nettle Growing"", ""Software Technology Interest Group"", ""Software Technology Interest Group (CERN)"", ""Swift Target Identification Notification Grid"", ""Sustained Tolerance of Increased G"", ""Smart Targeting and Identification via Networked Geolocation"", ""Strike Team Investigators Negotiations Group"", ""Strike Team Investigative Narcotics Group""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER""]]","[""Stimulator of Interferon Genes""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

susceptibility,Who is at risk for Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura? ?,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorder. Most cases of TTP are acquired. Acquired TTP mostly occurs in adults, but it can affect children. The condition occurs more often in women and in Black people than in other groups.
                
Inherited TTP mainly affects newborns and children. Most people who have inherited TTP begin to have symptoms soon after birth. Some, however, don't have symptoms until they're adults.
                
It isn't clear what triggers inherited and acquired TTP, but some factors may play a role. These factors may include:
                
Some diseases and conditions, such as pregnancy, cancer, HIV, lupus, and infections
                
Some medical procedures, such as surgery and blood and marrow stem cell transplant

inheritance,Is thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency inherited ?,"The activity of the TPMT enzyme is inherited in a pattern described as autosomal codominant. Codominance means that two different versions of the gene are active (expressed), and both versions influence the genetic trait.  The TPMT gene can be classified as either low-activity or high-activity. When the gene is altered in a way that impairs the activity of the TPMT enzyme, it is described as low-activity. When the gene is unaltered and TPMT activity is normal, it is described as high-activity. Because two copies of the gene are present in each cell, each person can have two low-activity copies, one low-activity copy and one high-activity copy, or two high-activity copies.  People with two low-activity copies of the TPMT gene in each cell have TPMT deficiency and are at the greatest risk of developing hematopoietic toxicity when treated with thiopurine drugs unless they are given much less than the usual dose.

inheritance,Is WAGR syndrome inherited ?,"Most cases of WAGR syndrome are not inherited. They result from a chromosomal deletion that occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.  Some affected individuals inherit a chromosome 11 with a deleted segment from an unaffected parent. In these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems; however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. Individuals with WAGR syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the short arm of chromosome 11, which results in an increased risk of Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and intellectual disability.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""WAGR"", ""full_form"": ""Wilms tumor-Aniridia-Genitourinary anomalies-mental Retardation""}]}",Is WAGR syndrome inherited ?,Is Wilms tumor-Aniridia-Genitourinary anomalies-mental Retardation syndrome inherited ?,8,"[[""Western Australian Government Railways"", ""Wilms' Tumor, Aniridia, Gonadoblastoma, mental Retardation"", ""Winning Attitudes, Great Rewards"", ""World Amateur Golf Ranking"", ""Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility"", ""Windscale Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor"", ""Wilms&#39; tumor/Aniridia/Genitourinary Anomalies - Mental Retardation Syndrome"", ""Wilms' tumor/Aniridia/Genitourinary Anomalies - Mental Retardation Syndrome"", ""Windscale Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor"", ""Western Australian Government Railways (Australia)"", ""World Amateur Golf Ranking (St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland, UK)""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary anomalies, and Range of developmental delays""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

exams and tests,How to diagnose Parasites - African Trypanosomiasis (also known as Sleeping Sickness) ?,"The diagnosis of African Trypanosomiasis is made through laboratory methods, because the clinical features of infection are not sufficiently specific. The diagnosis rests on finding the parasite in body fluid or tissue by microscopy. The parasite load in T. b. rhodesiense infection is substantially higher than the level in T. b. gambiense infection.
    
T. b. rhodesiense parasites can easily be found in blood. They can also be found in lymph node fluid or in fluid or biopsy of a chancre. Serologic testing is not widely available and is not used in the diagnosis, since microscopic detection of the parasite is straightforward.
    
The classic method for diagnosing T. b. gambiense infection is by microscopic examination of lymph node aspirate, usually from a posterior cervical node. It is often difficult to detect T. b. gambiense in blood. Concentration techniques and serial examinations are frequently needed. Serologic testing is available outside the U.S. for T. b. gambiense; however, it normally is used for screening purposes only and the definitive diagnosis rests on microscopic observation of the parasite.
    
All patients diagnosed with African trypanosomiasis must have their cerebrospinal fluid examined to determine whether there is involvement of the central nervous system, since the choice of treatment drug(s) will depend on the disease stage. The World Health Organization criteria for central nervous system involvement include increased protein in cerebrospinal fluid and a white cell count of more than 5. Trypanosomes can often be observed in cerebrospinal fluid in persons with second stage infection.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency ?,"Mutations in the CPS1 gene cause carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency. The CPS1 gene provides instructions for making the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, which is a sequence of biochemical reactions that occurs in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is broken down by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. The specific role of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I enzyme is to control the first step of the urea cycle, a reaction in which excess nitrogen compounds are incorporated into the cycle to be processed.  Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. In this condition, the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I enzyme is at low levels (deficient) or absent, and the urea cycle cannot proceed normally. As a result, nitrogen accumulates in the bloodstream in the form of toxic ammonia instead of being converted to less toxic urea and excreted. Ammonia is especially damaging to the brain, and excess ammonia causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CPS I"", ""full_form"": ""carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to CPS I deficiency ?,What are the genetic changes related to carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency ?,8,"[[""Canadian Provincial Standards on Immunization"", ""Computer Programs and Systems Inc"", ""Certified Playground Safety Inspector"", ""Creative Problem Solving Institute"", ""Center for Public Safety Initiatives"", ""Center for Public Safety Innovation"", ""Command Post Systems and Integration"", ""Canadian Patient Safety Institute"", ""Cells Per Square Inch"", ""Canadian Patient Safety Institute (Edmonton, AB, Canada)"", ""cells per square inch"", ""California Property Specialists, Inc.

inheritance,Is MECP2 duplication syndrome inherited ?,"Is MECP2 duplication syndrome inherited? MECP2 duplication syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. A condition is considered X-linked if the genetic change that causes the condition is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes (the Y chromosome is the other sex chromosome). In males (who have only one X chromosome), a duplication of the MECP2 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a duplication of one of the two copies of the gene typically does not cause the disorder. Early in the development of females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly and permanently inactivated in each cell (called X-inactivation). X-inactivation prevents female cells from having twice as many functional X chromosomes as males. Because X-inactivation is usually random, the X chromosome inherited from the mother is active in some cells, and the X chromosome inherited from the father is active in other cells. However, when a female has an X chromosome with a duplicated copy of the MECP2 gene, the abnormal chromosome is often preferentially inactivated in many or all cells. This is called ""skewed X-inactivation."" It prevents some women with an MECP2 duplication from developing features of the duplication since the extra genetic material is not active. In most cases, MECP2 duplication syndrome is inherited from a mother who has no signs or symptoms of the duplication. Rarely, the condition is not inherited and occurs due to a random event during the formation of the egg or sperm, or in early fetal development. When this happens, it is called a de novo duplication (occurring as a new genetic change for the first time in the affected person).","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""MECP2"", ""full_form"": ""Methyl CpG binding protein 2""}]}",Is MECP2 duplication syndrome inherited ?,Is Methyl CpG binding protein 2 duplication syndrome inherited ?,8,"[[""MeCP2"", ""Methyl CpG (Cytosine Phosphate Guanine) Binding Protein 2""]]","[[""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

causes,What causes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?,"Despite a vigorous search, scientists have not yet identified what causes CFS. While a single cause for CFS may yet be identified, another possibility is that CFS has multiple causes. Conditions that have been studied to determine if they cause or trigger the development of CFS include infections, immune disorders, stress, trauma, and toxins.
  Infection
  
Various types of infections have been studied to determine if they might cause or trigger CFS:
  
   - Candida albicans, a fungus that causes yeast infections
   - Mycoplasma, a cause of atypical pneumonia
   - Ross River virus, which causes Ross River Fever, a mosquito-borne tropical disease
  
  Could One Type of Infection Lead to CFS?
  
Researchers from around the world have studied if a single type of infection might be the cause of CFS, analyzed the data, and not yet found any association between CFS and infection. Researchers are still analyzing samples from CFS patients using the latest molecular methods to search for previously unknown infections (pathogen discovery). To date, these studies suggest that no one infection or pathogen causes CFS and that the illness may be triggered by a variety of illnesses or conditions. In fact, infection with Epstein-Barr virus, Ross River virus, and Coxiella burnetti will lead to a post-infective condition that meets the criteria for CFS in approximately 10-12% of cases. People who had severe symptoms when they became infected were more likely than those with mild symptoms to later develop CFS symptoms. The possibility remains that there may be a variety of different ways in which patients can develop CFS.
  Immune System and Allergies
  
Studies have looked to see if changes in a person's immune system might lead to CFS. The findings have been mixed. Similarities in symptoms from immune responses to infection and CFS lead to hypotheses that CFS may be caused by stress or a viral infection, which may lead to the chronic production of cytokines and then to CFS.
  
Antibodies against normal parts of the body (auto-antibodies) and immune complexes have been seen in some CFS patients. However, no associated tissue damage typical of autoimmune disease has been described in CFS patients. The opportunistic infections or increased risk for cancer observed in persons with immunodeficiency diseases or in immunosuppressed individuals is also not observed in CFS.
  
T-cell activation markers have been reported to be different between groups of CFS patients and healthy persons, but not all investigators have consistently observed these differences.
  
Allergic diseases and secondary illnesses such as sinusitis could be one predisposing factor for CFS, but not all CFS patients have allergies. Many patients do, however, report intolerances for certain substances that may be found in foods or over-the-counter medications, such as alcohol.
  
                
  Hypothalamic-Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) Axis
  
The central nervous system plays an important role in CFS. Physical or emotional stress, which is commonly reported as a pre-onset condition in CFS patients, alters the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or HPA axis, leading to altered release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), cortisol, and other hormones. These hormones can influence the immune system and many other body systems.
  
Some CFS patients produce lower levels of cortisol than do healthy people. Similar hormonal abnormalities have also been observed among CFS patients and in persons with related disorders like fibromyalgia. Cortisol suppresses inflammation and cellular immune activation, and reduced levels might relax constraints on inflammatory processes and immune cell activation. Even though CFS patients had lower levels of cortisol than healthy individuals, their cortisol levels were still within the acceptable range of what is considered normal. Therefore, doctors cannot use cortisol levels as a way to diagnose CFS.
  
                
  Abnormally Low Blood Pressure and Lightheadedness (Neurally Mediated Hypotension)
  
Disturbances in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and pulse have been found in CFS patients. This problem with maintaining blood pressure can be diagnosed by using tilt table testing, which involves laying the patient horizontally on a table and then tilting the table upright to 70 degrees for 45 minutes while monitoring blood pressure and heart rate. Persons with neurally mediated hypotension (NMH) or postural orthostatic tachycardia (POTS) will develop lower blood pressure under these conditions, as well as other characteristic symptoms, such as lightheadedness, visual dimming, or a slow response to verbal stimuli. Others may develop an unusually rapid heart rate also associated with the symptoms of the syndrome. Many CFS patients experience lightheadedness or worsened fatigue when they stand for prolonged periods or when in warm places, such as in a hot shower -- all circumstances that are known to trigger NMH or POTS.
  
NMH and/or POTS share some of the symptoms of CFS. They should be considered in a CFS patients whose symptoms are worsened with changes in position, after eating, following unusual amounts of or inadequate fluid intake, or increases in activity. Not all patients with CFS will have these conditions, however.
  
                
  Nutritional Deficiency
  
There is no published scientific evidence that CFS is caused by a nutritional deficiency. While evidence is currently lacking for nutritional defects in CFS patients, it should also be added that a balanced diet can be favorable to better health in general and would be expected to benefit a person with any chronic illness.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CFS"", ""full_form"": ""Chronic Fatigue Syndrome""}]}",What causes CFS?,What causes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?,8,"[[""Chronic Fatigue Syndrome"", ""Combat Flight Simulator"", ""Canadian Federation of Students"", ""Container Freight Station"", ""Center for Food Safety"", ""Child and Family Services"", ""Cubic Feet per Second"", ""Commodity Flow Survey"", ""Cryptographic File System"", ""Certified Fund Specialist""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Chronic Fatigue Syndrome""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

inheritance,Is alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins inherited ?,"ACD/MPV is usually not inherited, and most affected people have no history of the disorder in their family. The genetic changes associated with this condition usually occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. When the condition is caused by a FOXF1 gene mutation or deletion, one altered or missing gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Individuals with ACD/MPV do not pass the genetic change on to their children because they do not live long enough to reproduce.  A few families have been identified in which more than one sibling has ACD/MPV. It is not clear how ACD/MPV is inherited in these families because no genetic changes have been identified.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""ACD/MPV"", ""full_form"": ""alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins""}]}",Is ACD/MPV inherited ?,Is alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins inherited ?,8,[[]],[[]],"[""Axial Chromatic Disperson / Mean Platelet Volume""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Factor V Leiden thrombophilia ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of factor V Leiden thrombophilia? Individuals affected by factor V Leiden thrombophilia have an increased risk of developing blood clots. The severity of factor V Leiden thrombophilia is extremely variable. Many individuals with the factor V Leiden allele never develop a blood clot. Although most individuals with factor V thrombophilia do not experience their first thrombotic event until adulthood, some have recurrent thromboembolism before age 30 years. The chance a person will develop a blood clot is affected by the number of factor V Leiden mutations, the presence of coexisting genetic abnormalities, and non-genetic risk factors.  Non-genetic risk factors include surgery, long periods of not moving (like sitting on a long airplane ride), birth control pills and other female hormones, childbirth within the last 6 months, and traumas or fractures. Individuals who inherit one copy of the factor V Leiden mutation have a fourfold to eightfold increase in the chance of developing a clot.  Homozygotes (people who inherit two factor V Leiden mutations) may have up to 80 times the usual risk of developing a blood clot. Considering that the risk of developing an abnormal blood clot averages about 1 in 1,000 per year in the general population, the presence of one copy of the factor V Leiden mutation increases that risk to 4 to 8 in 1,000, and having two copies of the mutation may raise the risk as high as 80 in 1,000. People with factor V Leiden have an increased chance of having a blood clot that forms in large veins in the legs (deep venous thrombosis, or DVT) or a clot that travels through the bloodstream and lodges in the lungs (pulmonary embolism, or PE). Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis usually include leg pain, tenderness, swelling, increased warmth or redness in one leg. The symptoms of pulmonary embolism usually include cough, chest pain, shortness of breath or rapid heartbeat or breathing.

exams and tests,How to diagnose Cramp-fasciculation syndrome ?,"How is cramp-fasciculation syndrome diagnosed?  A diagnosis of cramp-fasciculation syndrome is generally based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Namely, a history of frequent muscle cramps, twitching, and pain (often worsened by exercise) without muscle weakness or wasting is suggestive of the condition.

treatment,What are the treatments for Renal Artery Stenosis ?,"Treatment for RAS includes lifestyle changes, medications, and surgery and aims to
                
- prevent RAS from getting worse  - treat RVH  - relieve the blockage of the renal arteries
                
RAS that has not led to RVH or caused a significant blockage of the artery may not need treatment. RAS that needs to be treated, also called critical RAS, is defined by the American Heart Association as a reduction by more than 60 percent in the diameter of the renal artery.1 However, health care providers are not exactly sure what degree of blockage will cause significant problems.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
The first step in treating RAS is making lifestyle changes that promote healthy blood vessels throughout the body, including the renal arteries. The best ways to keep plaque from building up in the arteries are to exercise, maintain a healthy body weight, and choose healthy foods. People who smoke should quit to help protect their kidneys and other internal organs.
                
Medications
                
People with RVH may need to take medications thatwhen taken as prescribed by their health care providerlower blood pressure and can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. Two types of blood pressure-lowering medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a diuretica medication that helps the kidneys remove fluid from the bloodmay be prescribed. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications may also be needed. Some people with RAS cannot take an ACE inhibitor or ARB due to the effects on the kidneys. People with RAS who are prescribed an ACE inhibitor or ARB should have their kidney function checked within a few weeks of starting the medication.
                
A cholesterol-lowering medication to prevent plaque from building up in the arteries and a blood-thinner, such as aspirin, to help the blood flow more easily through the arteries may also be prescribed.
                
Surgery
                
Although surgery has been used in the past for treatment of RAS due to atherosclerosis, recent studies have not shown improved outcomes with surgery compared with medication. However, surgery may be recommended for people with RAS caused by FMD or RAS that does not improve with medication. Different types of surgery for RAS include the following. The procedures are performed in a hospital by a vascular surgeona doctor who specializes in repairing blood vessels. Anesthesia is needed.
                
- Angioplasty and stenting. Angioplasty is a procedure in which a catheter is put into the renal artery, usually through the groin, just as in a catheter angiogram. In addition, for angioplasty, a tiny balloon at the end of the catheter can be inflated to flatten the plaque against the artery wall. A small mesh tube, called a stent, may then be positioned inside the artery to keep plaque flattened and the artery open. People with RAS caused by FMD may be successfully treated with angioplasty alone, while angioplasty with stenting has a better outcome for people with RAS caused by atherosclerosis.  - Endarterectomy or bypass surgery. In an endarterectomy, the plaque is cleaned out of the artery, leaving the inside lining smooth and clear. To create a bypass, a vein or synthetic tube is used to connect the kidney to the aorta. This new path serves as an alternate route for blood to flow around the blocked artery into the kidney. These procedures are not performed as often as in the past due to a high risk of complications during and after the procedure.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""RAS"", ""full_form"": ""Renal Artery Stenosis""}]}",What are the treatments for RAS ?,What are the treatments for Renal Artery Stenosis ?,8,"[[""Russian Academy Of Sciences"", ""Royal Astronomical Society"", ""Remote Access Service"", ""Remote Access Server"", ""Reliability Availability And Serviceability"", ""Remote Access Services"", ""Renal Artery Stenosis"", ""Renin Angiotensin System"", ""Reticular Activating System"", ""River Analysis System""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Renin-Angiotensin System""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to Ellis-van Creveld syndrome ?,"Ellis-van Creveld syndrome can be caused by mutations in the EVC or EVC2 gene. Little is known about the function of these genes, although they appear to play important roles in cell-to-cell signaling during development. In particular, the proteins produced from the EVC and EVC2 genes are thought to help regulate the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway. This pathway plays roles in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body.  The mutations that cause Ellis-van Creveld syndrome result in the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the EVC or EVC2 protein. It is unclear how the defective proteins lead to the specific signs and symptoms of this condition. Studies suggest that they prevent normal Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo, disrupting the formation and growth of the bones, teeth, and other parts of the body.  Together, mutations in the EVC and EVC2 genes account for more than half of all cases of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome. The cause of the remaining cases is unknown.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""EVC"", ""full_form"": ""Ellis-van Creveld""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to EVC syndrome ?,What are the genetic changes related to Ellis-van Creveld syndrome ?,8,"[[""Executive Vice Chancellor"", ""Entravision Communications Corporation"", ""Electronic Valve Controller"", ""Eaton Vance Corporation"", ""Executrain Virtual Campus"", ""Equilibrium Vapor Concentration"", ""Electronic Voucher Charging"", ""Enhanced vMotion Compatibility"", ""Equipping Vital Congregations"", ""Evasion Chart""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Ellis-van Creveld syndrome""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1E ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1E? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1E. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Areflexia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Childhood onset - Decreased motor nerve conduction velocity - Distal muscle weakness - Distal sensory impairment - Foot dorsiflexor weakness - Hammertoe - Hyporeflexia - Juvenile onset - Pes cavus - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Split hand - Steppage gait - Talipes calcaneovalgus - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""CMT1E"", ""full_form"": ""Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1E""}]}",What are the symptoms of CMT1E ?,What are the symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1E ?,8,[[]],[[]],"[""Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1E""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of GOMBO syndrome ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of GOMBO syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for GOMBO syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of cardiovascular system morphology - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Brachydactyly syndrome - Clinodactyly - Delayed puberty - Intellectual disability, progressive - Intellectual disability, severe - Microcephaly - Microphthalmia - Radial deviation of finger - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""GOMBO"", ""full_form"": ""Growth retardation, Ocular abnormalities, Microcephaly, Brachydactyly, and Oligophrenia""}]}",What are the symptoms of GOMBO syndrome ?,"What are the symptoms of Growth retardation, Ocular abnormalities, Microcephaly, Brachydactyly, and Oligophrenia syndrome ?",8,[[]],[[]],"[""Genito-Oculo-Musculo-Skeletal-Brain syndrome""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

treatment,What are the treatments for Arteriovenous Malformation ?,"Treatment options depend on the type of AVM, its location, noticeable symptoms, and the general health condition of the individual. Medication can often alleviate general symptoms such as headache, back pain, and seizures caused by AVMs and other vascular lesions. The definitive treatment for AVMs is either surgery to either remove the AVM or to create an artificial blood clot to close the lesion or focused irradiation treatment that is designed to damage the blood vessel walls and close the lesion. The decision to treat an AVM requires a careful consideration of possible benefits versus risks.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""AVM"", ""full_form"": ""Arteriovenous Malformation""}]}",What are the treatments for AVM ?,What are the treatments for Arteriovenous Malformation ?,8,"[[""Automated Valuation Model"", ""Advanced Magnetics, Inc."", ""Automated Valuation Models"", ""Advanced Video Movement"", ""Automatic Vehicle Monitoring"", ""Arterio Venous Malformation"", ""Active Virtual Memory"", ""Attribute Value Matrix"", ""Arterial Venous Malformation"", ""Advance Video Movement""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Arteriovenous Malformation""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

inheritance,Is X-linked agammaglobulinemia inherited ?,"This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.  About half of affected individuals do not have a family history of XLA. In most of these cases, the affected person's mother is a carrier of one altered BTK gene. Carriers do not have the immune system abnormalities associated with XLA, but they can pass the altered gene to their children. In other cases, the mother is not a carrier and the affected individual has a new mutation in the BTK gene.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""XLA"", ""full_form"": ""X-linked agammaglobulinemia""}]}",Is XLA inherited ?,Is X-linked agammaglobulinemia inherited ?,0,"[[""X- Linked Agammaglobulinaemia"", ""Xcelera.Com, Inc."", ""Excel Add-in macro sheet"", ""Xlib graphics library Archive"", ""X Linked Agammaglobulinemia"", ""Xbox Live Arcade"", ""X Linked Agammaglobulinaemia"", ""Xenopus Laevis African"", ""Excel Add-in"", ""X-Box Live Arcade""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""X-linked Agammaglobulinemia""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

research,what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?,"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Proton beam radiation therapy     Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small, positively-charged pieces of matter) to make radiation. This type of radiation kills tumor cells with little damage to nearby tissues. It is used to treat cancers of the head, neck, and spine and organs such as the brain, eye, lung, and prostate. Proton beam radiation is different from x-ray radiation.        Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.    Biologic therapy is being studied for the treatment of some types of brain tumors. Treatments may include the following:            -  Dendritic cell vaccine therapy.     -  Gene therapy.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to Jacobsen syndrome ?,"Jacobsen syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material at the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 11. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals, with most affected people missing 5 million to 16 million DNA building blocks (also written as 5 Mb to 16 Mb). In almost all affected people, the deletion includes the tip of chromosome 11. Larger deletions tend to cause more severe signs and symptoms than smaller deletions.  The features of Jacobsen syndrome are likely related to the loss of multiple genes on chromosome 11. Depending on its size, the deleted region can contain from about 170 to more than 340 genes. Many of these genes have not been well characterized. However, genes in this region appear to be critical for the normal development of many parts of the body, including the brain, facial features, and heart. Only a few genes have been studied as possible contributors to the specific features of Jacobsen syndrome; researchers are working to determine which additional genes may be associated with this condition.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""JBS"", ""full_form"": ""Jacobsen syndrome""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to JBS ?,What are the genetic changes related to Jacobsen syndrome ?,8,"[[""John Birch Society"", ""Journal of Biomolecular Screening"", ""Jump and Blow Stack"", ""Jewels By Star"", ""Jack Bingham Studio"", ""Pleasanton, California USA"", ""Joel B.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""IMAGe"", ""full_form"": ""Intrauterine growth restriction, Metaphyseal dysplasia, Adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and Genital anomalies""}]}",What are the symptoms of IMAGe syndrome ?,"What are the symptoms of Intrauterine growth restriction, Metaphyseal dysplasia, Adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and Genital anomalies syndrome ?",8,"[[""Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration"", ""Integrated Molecular Analysis of Gene Expression"", ""Increasing Minority Access To Graduate Education"", ""Imager for Magnetopause to Auroral Global Exploration"", ""Disk Image (Disk Copy, ShrinkWrap)"", ""International Missions Apprenticeship For Gods Evangelists"", ""International Medicine And Graduate Education"", ""International Missions Apprenticeship For God's Evangelists"", ""Information Manipulation Archiving Gathering And Extraction"", ""Impacting Men to Achieve Greater Excellence""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Intrauterine growth restriction, Metaphyseal dysplasia, Adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and Genital anomalies""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cognitive impairment 90% Convex nasal ridge 90% Deeply set eye 90% Delayed skeletal maturation 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% External ear malformation 90% Frontal bossing 90% High forehead 90% Hyperphosphatemia 90% Hypocalcemia 90% Hypoparathyroidism 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Long philtrum 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Microcephaly 90% Seizures 90% Short foot 90% Short palm 90% Short stature 90% Thin vermilion border 90% Abnormality of dental enamel 50% Recurrent respiratory infections 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia affecting the eye 7.5% Astigmatism 7.5% Cellular immunodeficiency 7.5% Cryptorchidism 7.5% Hypoplasia of penis 7.5% Increased bone mineral density 7.5% Intestinal obstruction 7.5% Myopathy 7.5% Opacification of the corneal stroma 7.5% Spinal canal stenosis 7.5% Ventriculomegaly 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bifid uvula - Congenital hypoparathyroidism - Hypocalcemic seizures - Intellectual disability - Low-set ears - Micropenis - Patchy osteosclerosis - Posteriorly rotated ears - Postnatal growth retardation - Prominent forehead - Recurrent bacterial infections - Severe intrauterine growth retardation - Small hand - Tetany - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""HRD"", ""full_form"": ""Hypoparathyroidism-retardation-dysmorphism""}]}",What are the symptoms of HRD syndrome ?,What are the symptoms of Hypoparathyroidism-retardation-dysmorphism syndrome ?,8,"[[""Human Resources Development"", ""Human Resources Department"", ""Hurricane Research Division"", ""Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram"", ""Human Readable Description"", ""High Resolution Display"", ""Hannaford Brothers Company"", ""Historical Research Development"", ""Hard Rocker Dude"", ""Human Resource Development""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Homologous Recombination Deficiency""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cerebral atrophy - Dementia - Diplopia - Distal sensory impairment - Dysarthria - Encephalopathy - Gliosis - Myoclonus - Neuronal loss in central nervous system - Nystagmus - Seizures - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""FENIB"", ""full_form"": ""Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies""}]}",What are the symptoms of FENIB ?,What are the symptoms of Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies ?,8,"[[""Familial Encephalopathy with Neuroserpin Inclusion Bodies"", ""Familial Encephalopathy with Neuroserpin Inclusion Bodies""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

treatment,What are the treatments for Loin pain hematuria syndrome ?,"How might loin pain hematuria syndrome be treated? Treatment of loin pain hematuria syndrome (LPHS) typically consists of pain management. Narcotics or oral opioids may be prescribed to help control pain. Patients with severe pain may need high-dose opioids daily and may occasionally require hospitalization for intravenous pain relievers and control of nausea. Limited evidence suggests that drugs that inhibit angiotensin may reduce the frequency and severity of episodes of loin pain and severe hematuria. People with debilitating pain who do not respond to other therapies may be offered surgery (i.e. a nerve block, nephrectomy, kidney auto-transplantation); however, surgical treatment of LPHS is controversial as studies suggest that it has limited value for treating recurrent pain.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""LPHS"", ""full_form"": ""Loin pain hematuria syndrome""}]}",What are the treatments for LPHS ?,What are the treatments for Loin pain hematuria syndrome ?,8,"[[""La Plata High School"", ""Lake Park High School"", ""Las Plumas High School"", ""LaSalle-Peru High School"", ""Lewis-Palmer High School"", ""Leyte Progressive High School"", ""Lincoln Park High School"", ""Lindsay Place High School"", ""Loin Pain Hematuria Syndrome"", ""Lone Peak High School""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS""]]","[""Loin Pain Hematuria Syndrome""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

genetic changes,What are the genetic changes related to CASK-related intellectual disability ?,"CASK-related intellectual disability, as its name suggests, is caused by mutations in the CASK gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK). The CASK protein is primarily found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, where it helps control the activity (expression) of other genes that are involved in brain development. It also helps regulate the movement of chemicals called neurotransmitters and of charged atoms (ions), which are necessary for signaling between neurons. Research suggests that the CASK protein may also interact with the protein produced from another gene, FRMD7, to promote development of the nerves that control eye movement (the oculomotor neural network).  Mutations in the CASK gene affect the role of the CASK protein in brain development and function, resulting in the signs and symptoms of CASK-related intellectual disability. The severe form of this disorder, MICPCH, is caused by mutations that eliminate CASK function, while mutations that impair the function of this protein cause the milder form, XL-ID with or without nystagmus. Affected individuals with nystagmus may have CASK gene mutations that disrupt the interaction between the CASK protein and the protein produced from the FRMD7 gene, leading to problems with the development of the oculomotor neural network and resulting in abnormal eye movements.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""abbreviation"", ""abbreviation"": ""CASK"", ""full_form"": ""Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Serine Protein Kinase""}]}",What are the genetic changes related to CASK-related intellectual disability ?,What are the genetic changes related to Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Serine Protein Kinase-related intellectual disability ?,8,"[[""Cost of Available Seat Kilometer"", ""Creative Art Space for Kids"", ""Cost of Available Seat-Kilometer"", ""Cost Per Available Seat Kilometre"", ""Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Serine Protein Kinase"", ""Community Advanced Starter Kit (software)"", ""Creative Art Space for Kids Foundation (Lynbrook, NY)"", ""Chesapeake Association of Sea Kayakers (Tidewater, VA)"", ""Cost of Available Seat-Kilometer (airline industry)"", ""Community Advanced Starter Kit (software)"", ""Chesapeake Association of Sea Kayakers (Tidewater, VA)"", ""Creative Art Space for Kids Foundation (Lynbrook, NY)"", ""Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Serine Protein Kinase"", ""Cost of Available Seat-Kilometer (airline industry)""]]","[[""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ABBREVIATIONS"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY"", ""THEFREEDICTIONARY""]]","[""Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Serine Protein Kinase""]","Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

causes,What causes EEC syndrome ?,"What causes EEC syndrome? Approximately 90% of individuals with EEC syndrome have a causative mutation identified in the TP63 gene. The TP63 gene codes for the p63 protein, which plays a critical role in early development of the ectoderm-the layers of tissue that develop into the skin, hair, teeth, and nails. The p63 protein is additionally thought to play a role in the development of the limbs, facial features, urinary system, and other organs. Individuals that have EEC syndrome due to a mutation in the TP63 gene are classified as having EEC syndrome type 3 (EEC3). In approximately 10% of individuals, EEC syndrome is caused by a mutation on a region of the q (long) arm of chromosome 7.

exams and tests,How to diagnose Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum ?,"How might hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC) be diagnosed? Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC) is diagnosed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain.  When the following three features are identified in the brain of an affected individuals, the diagnosis of H-ABC can be made: Decreased myelin (hypomyelination) in the brain.  Myelin usually forms a protective covering around brain cells.  In H-ABC, this covering is thinner than usual which makes it difficult for nerve cells to work properly. Breakdown (atrophy) of the basal ganglia, a part of the brain that directs and controls movement. Atrophy of the cerebellum, another part of the brain that controls movement.","{""full_form_abbrv_map"": [{""ambiguity_type"": ""full_form"", ""abbreviation"": ""H-ABC"", ""full_form"": ""Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum""}]}",How to diagnose H-ABC ?,How to diagnose Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum ?,8,"[[""Health, Aging and Body Composition Study"", ""Housing Authority of Baltimore City"", ""Health Association of British Columbia (Canada)"", ""Houston Asset Building Coalition (TX)"", ""Hopwood American Bulldog Club (UK)"", ""Hamilton Acres Baptist Church (Fairbanks, AK)""]]","[[""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER"", ""ACRONYMFINDER""]]","[""Hypomyelination with Atrophy of the Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum""]","Instructional: Queries specifically seeking step-by-step guidance, instructions, or procedures to perform a task. it focuses on 'how' to do something rather than 'what', 'why', or 'which'.",[4.58136365591322e-35],[9.155753622033251e-36],"[""Health, Aging and Body Composition Study""]",[8.604904232527061e-30],"[""ACRONYMFINDER""]","[[8.604904232527061e-30, 8.711052950353426e-32, 7.813360305780717e-41, 5.318328371046634e-37, 9.070200929735953e-38, 3.5465001372309182e-50]]",[0.8439574787471747],[0.845402182992782],"[""Hamilton Acres Baptist Church (Fairbanks, AK)""]",[0.845402182992782],"[""LLM""]","[[0.7476312169582285, 0.6819674028612709, 0.818919843031948, 0.7244704010647656, 0.7675965072021441, 0.7784030087407232]]","[""Hypomyelination with Atrophy of the Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum""]","[""LLM""]","How to diagnose H-ABC (Hamilton Acres Baptist Church (Fairbanks, AK)) ?",[true],[true],[true],"[""Diagnosing H-ABC typically involves genetic testing to identify mutations in the TUBB4A gene, MRI scans to detect characteristic brain abnormalities, and neurological examinations to assess symptoms.""]","[""Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum can be diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies such as MRI, genetic testing, and possibly a muscle or nerve biopsy.""]","[""Diagnosing H-ABC involves genetic testing to identify mutations in the TUBB4A gene, MRI scans to assess brain abnormalities, and neurological examinations to evaluate symptoms.""]",[true],[true],[true],"[""Diagnosing H-ABC involves genetic testing to identify mutations in the TUBB4A gene, MRI scans to assess brain abnormalities, and neurological examinations to evaluate symptoms such as spasticity and muscle weakness.""]","[""Diagnosing Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum typically involves conducting a brain MRI to assess the extent of myelination and atrophy in these regions.

prevention,how can patients prevent the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci?,"On this Page General Information What is vancomycin-resistant enterococci? What types of infections does vancomycin-resistant enterococci cause? Are certain people at risk of getting vancomycin-resistant enterococci? What is the treatment for vancomycin-resistant enterococci? How is vancomycin-resistant enterococci spread? How can patients prevent the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci? What should a patient do if they think they have vancomycin-resistant enterococci? Recommendations and Guidelines General Information For more images of this bacterium, search the Public Health Image Library What is vancomycin-resistant enterococci? Enteroccocci are bacteria that are normally present in the human intestines and in the female genital tract and are often found in the environment. These bacteria can sometimes cause infections. Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat some drug-resistant infections caused by enterococci. In some instances, enterococci have become resistant to this drug and thus are called vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Most VRE infections occur in hospitals. Top of page What types of infections does VRE cause? VRE can live in the human intestines and female genital tract without causing disease (often called colonization). However, sometimes it can cause infections of the urinary tract, the bloodstream, or of wounds associated with catheters or surgical procedures. Top of page Are certain people at risk of getting VRE? The following persons are at increased risk becoming infected with VRE: People who have been previously treated with the antibiotic vancomycin or other antibiotics for long periods of time. People who are hospitalized, particularly when they receive antibiotic treatment for long periods of time. People with weakened immune systems such as patients in intensive care units, or in cancer or transplant wards. People who have undergone surgical procedures such as abdominal or chest surgery. People with medical devices that stay in for some time such as urinary catheters or central intravenous (IV) catheters. People who are colonized with VRE. Top of page What is the treatment for VRE? People with colonized VRE (bacteria are present, but have no symptoms of an infection)  do not need treatment. Most VRE infections can be treated with antibiotics other than vancomycin. Laboratory testing of the VRE can determine which antibiotics will work. For people who get VRE infections in their bladder and have urinary catheters, removal of the catheter when it is no longer needed can also help get rid of the infection. Top of page How is VRE spread? VRE is often passed from person to person by the contaminated hands of caregivers. VRE can get onto a caregiver's hands after they have contact with other people with VRE or after contact with contaminated surfaces. VRE can also be spread directly to people after they touch surfaces that are contaminated with VRE. VRE is not spread through the air by coughing or sneezing. Top of page How can patients prevent the spread of VRE? If a patient or someone in their household has VRE, the following are some things they can do to prevent the spread of VRE: Keep their hands clean. Always wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and before preparing food. Clean their hands after contact with persons who have VRE. Wash with soap and water (particularly when visibly soiled) or use alcohol-based hand rubs. Frequently clean areas of the home, such as bathrooms, that may become contaminated with VRE. Wear gloves if hands may come in contact with body fluids that may contain VRE, such as stool or bandages from infected wounds. Always wash their hands after removing gloves. If someone has VRE, be sure to tell healthcare providers so that they are aware of the infection. Healthcare facilities use special precautions to help prevent the spread of VRE to others. Top of page What should patients do if they think they have vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)? Anyone who thinks they have VRE must talk with their healthcare provider.
