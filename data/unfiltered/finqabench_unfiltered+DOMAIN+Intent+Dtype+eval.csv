1,"What standards were used to audit Apple Inc.'s financial statements for the period ended September 24, 2022?",The audits were conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the 'PCAOB').,"statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In accounting for uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws. Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 50 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements. \/s\/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009. San Jose, California October 27, 2022 Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 51 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \/s\/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California October 27, 2022 Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52 Item 9.

2,"What measures does the Company take to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers?","The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. The Company has also taken additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. 
These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal 
business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products 
and services, impact the Company’s stock price , materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to 
litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks 
are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques 
that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the 
Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers 
can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.
Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many 
companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and 
the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.
The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent 
unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of 
encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all 
eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty 
password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ 
employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for 
unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the 
Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for 
unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or 
loss of customer orders or impede  customer access to the Company’s products and services.
While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such 
insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not 
originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and 
financial condition.

Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company's products could be delayed or prohibited from importation, either of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.","Business Risks

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 33 Apple Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. ® ® Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34 For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the",Hallucination: Direct Question,apple-10K-2022.pdf,https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000320193/b4266e40-1de6-4a34-9dfb-8632b8bd57e0.pdf,3,BUSINESS,Compound Datatype-List/Array,"Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

30,What actions can be taken with respect to the 2018 Indenture regarding the provisions of one or more series of debt securities?,"In the case of the 2018 Indenture, actions that can be taken include adding to, changing, or eliminating any of the provisions of the 2018 Indenture in respect of one or more series of debt securities, provided that any such addition, change, or elimination shall become effective only when there is no outstanding security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture that is entitled to the benefit of such provision and as to which such supplemental indenture would apply.","• in the case of the 2018 Indenture, to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the 2018 Indenture in respect of one or more series of debt securities; provided that any such addition, change or elimination shall become effective only when there is no outstanding security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture that is entitled to the benefit of such provision and as to which such supplemental indenture would apply; • to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; • to change any other provision; provided that the change does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of debt securities of, in the case of the 2013 Indenture any series, and in the case of the 2018 Indenture, any outstanding series, in any material respect; • to supplement any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of Notes pursuant to the Indenture; 12 provided that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Notes of such series or any other series of debt securities in any material respect; • to comply with the rules or regulations of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which any of the Notes may be listed or traded; and • to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture as shall be necessary or desirable in accordance with any amendments to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and in the case of the 2013 Indenture, provided that such action does not adversely affect the rights or interests of any holder of debt securities in any material respect. The holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series may, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive compliance by us with certain restrictive provisions of the Indentures. The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of a series may, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive any past default and its consequences under the applicable Indenture with respect to the Notes of that series, except a default (1) in the payment of principal or premium, if any, or interest on Notes of that series or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision of the applicable Indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each Note of that series. Upon any such waiver, such default will cease to exist, and any event of default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of the Indenture; however, no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other default or event of default or impair any rights consequent thereon. Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance We may discharge certain obligations to holders of the Notes of a series that have not already been delivered to the trustee for cancellation and that either have become due and payable or will become due and payable within one year (or scheduled for redemption within one year) by depositing with the trustee, in trust, funds in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness including, but not limited to, the principal and premium, if any, and interest to the date of such deposit (if due and payable) or to the maturity thereof or the redemption date of the Notes of that series, as the case may be. We may direct the trustee to invest such funds in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less or in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term U.S. Treasury securities. The Indentures provide that we may elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to the Notes of a series (except for, among other things, obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, to maintain an office or agency with respect to the Notes and to hold moneys for payment in trust) (“legal defeasance”) or (2) to be released from our obligations to comply with the restrictive covenants under the applicable Indenture, and any omission to comply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the Notes of a series and clauses (3) and (6) under the caption “Events of Default” above will no longer be applied (“covenant defeasance”). Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be conditioned upon, among other things, the irrevocable deposit by us with the trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, applicable to the Notes of that series which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the scheduled due dates therefor. If we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes of any series, the amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from such event of default. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such amounts due at the time of acceleration. With respect to the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, the term “U.S. government obligations” shall instead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the German government or (ii) an obligation of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the German government the payment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the German government or the central bank of the German government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) 13 certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest in obligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect thereof. With respect to the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, the term “U.S. government obligations” shall instead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the United Kingdom government or (ii) an obligation of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United Kingdom government the payment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the United Kingdom government or the central bank of the United Kingdom government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest in obligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect thereof. We will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance will not cause the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes of that series to recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a change in law to that effect. We may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance option. Book-Entry and Settlement The Notes were issued in book-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, and are registered in the name of the common depositary or its nominee. Except as described herein, certificated notes will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the global notes.

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock.

Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies
Concentrations  in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product
Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain 
components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with 
other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many 
components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide 
shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.
The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by 
the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new 
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have 
increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to 
concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.
Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in 
Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services 
(“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for 
supplier arrangements, internet services and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase 
obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 24, 2022 , are as follows (in millions):

56,What risks does Apple Inc. face due to global climate change?,"Risks include difficulty or impossibility to manufacture and deliver products to customers, delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, substantial recovery time, significant expenditures to resume operations, and lost sales.","’s operations. Such restrictions can 
be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from 
such measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly 
more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade 
and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely 
affect the Company’s business.
Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract 
manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and 
facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial 
accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health 
issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate 
change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can 
make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and 
inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service 
offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant 
expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the 
supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any 
negative consequences to the Company.

60,What potential risks could Apple Inc. face if investigations into its App Store business result in adverse findings?,"If investigations into Apple Inc.'s App Store business result in adverse findings, the potential risks the company could face include significant fines, required changes to its App Store business, and material adverse effects on its overall business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, there could be legal proceedings and claims against the company, further impacting its business."," increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.  
From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market 
and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the EU 
Digital Markets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, could require further changes. These changes could include how and to 
what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App 
Store.
The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in 
legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact 
on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of 
investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse 
findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its 
App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial 
condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s 
business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.
Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become 
subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the 
Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, 
results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other 
companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently 
subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. 
However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations 
or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a 
portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Risk
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, 
option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally 
hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically  for up to  
12 months .
To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company 
designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 24, 2022 , the maximum length of time 
over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency 
transactions is 20 years .
The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins 
from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains 
and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Interest Rate Risk
To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into 
interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value 
hedges.
The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 24, 2022  and September 25, 2021  
were as follows (in millions):

Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:

73,What risks does the Company face in managing the transition to new and upgraded products and services?,"The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies.","Business Risks

82,"What are the two types of fair value estimates mentioned and their bases?
","Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 fair value estimates are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.","127,877 Total $ 189,961 $ 1,753 $ (1,198) $ 190,516 $ 34,940 $ 27,699 $ 127,877 (1) Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. (2) Level 2 fair value estimates are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. (3) As of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, total marketable securities included $12.7 billion and $17.9 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. (1) (2) (3) (1) (2) (3) Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 38 The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September 24, 2022 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 87,031 Due after 5 years through 10 years 16,429 Due after 10 years 17,345 Total fair value $ 120,805 Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 24, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 20 years. The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 102,670 $ 76,475 Interest rate contracts $ 20,125 $ 16,875 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 185,381 $ 126,918 Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 39 The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges Total Fair Value Derivative assets : Foreign exchange contracts $ 4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136 Derivative liabilities : Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752 Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367 (1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million. The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Hedged assets\/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 13,378 $ 15,954 Current and non-current term debt $ (18,739) $ (17,857) Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit- financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 44% and 42% of total trade receivables as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%.

83,"What is the maximum one-day loss in fair value of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions estimated with 95% confidence as of September 24, 2022?",$1.0 billion," 
the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of 
September 24, 2022 , compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021 . Because the 
Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are 
generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.
Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ 
materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September  24, 2022  due to the inherent limitations associated with 
predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual 
exposures and positions.

86,What factors can impact the Company's future gross margins?,"The factors that can impact the Company's future gross margins include:

- Continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures.
- Increased competition.
- The Company's ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain products and services.
- Compressed product life cycles.
- Supply shortages.
- Potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring, and delivering content for the Company's services.
- The Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively.
- Shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency, or channel mix.
- Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
- Inflation and other macroeconomic pressures.
- The introduction of new products or services, including those with higher cost structures.

These factors have the potential to have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition."," example, 
the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross 
margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global 
product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased 
competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product 
life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, 
acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs 
effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that 
regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; 
inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or 
services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of 
operations and financial condition.
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in 
part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of 
sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a 
decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to 
unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new 
product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the 
Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.

Payment Services The Company offers payment services, including Apple Card , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay , a cashless payment service. Markets and Distribution The Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2022, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales. Competition The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. ® ® ® SM ® ® ® ® ® Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2 The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research",Hallucination: Direct Question,apple-10K-2022.pdf,https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000320193/b4266e40-1de6-4a34-9dfb-8632b8bd57e0.pdf,3,BUSINESS,Compound Datatype-List/Array,"Informational: Encompasses seeking factual information, definitions, and explanations.

Epic Games
Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California 
District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law 
based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 
10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included 
in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California 
District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition 
law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay 
pending the appeal.
Other Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the 
ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth  quarter of 2022  that did not individually or in 
the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is 
inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above 
management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially 
adversely affected.
