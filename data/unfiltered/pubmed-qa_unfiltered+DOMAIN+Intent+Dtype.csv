Does hypoxia-ischemia brain damage disrupt brain cholesterol homeostasis in neonatal rats?,"['The first 3 weeks of life is the peak time of oligodendrocytes development and also the critical period of cholesterol increasing dramatically in central nervous system in rats.

Do base excision repair defects invoke hypersensitivity to PARP inhibition?,"['PARP-1 is important for the recognition of both endogenous and exogenous DNA damage, and binds to DNA strand breaks including intermediates of base excision repair (BER). Once DNA-bound, PARP-1 becomes catalytically activated synthesizing PAR polymers onto itself and other repair factors (PARylation). As a result, BER repair proteins such as XRCC1 and DNA polymerase β (pol β) are more efficiently and rapidly recruited to sites of DNA damage. In the presence of an inhibitor of PARP activity (PARPi), PARP-1 binds to sites of DNA damage, but PARylation is prevented. BER enzyme recruitment is hindered, but binding of PARP-1 to DNA is stabilized, impeding DNA repair and leading to double-strand DNA breaks (DSB). Deficiencies in pol β(-/-) and Xrcc1(-/-) cells resulted in hypersensitivity to the PARP inhibitor 4-AN and reexpression of pol β or XRCC1, in these contexts, reversed the 4-AN hypersensitivity phenotype. BER deficiencies also showed evidence of replication defects that lead to DSB-induced apoptosis upon PARPi treatment. Finally, the clinically relevant PARP inhibitors olaparib and veliparib also exhibited hypersensitivity in both pol β(-/-) and Xrcc1(-/-) BER-deficient cells. These results reveal heightened sensitivity to PARPi as a function of BER deficiency.']",['UNLABELLED'],"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1']",,,,yes,BER deficiency represents a new therapeutic opportunity to enhance PARPi efficacy.,8,MEDICAL,Simple Datatype-Boolean,"Analytical/Evaluative (Convergent Thinking): This merged category is for queries that involve dissecting complex information or data to understand underlying patterns, reasons, or to make informed judgements.

Does prediction of breast cancer prognosis using gene set statistics provide signature stability and biological context?,"['Different microarray studies have compiled gene lists for predicting outcomes of a range of treatments and diseases. These have produced gene lists that have little overlap, indicating that the results from any one study are unstable.

We classified breast cancer cases from five microarray studies according to the risk of metastasis, using features derived from predefined gene sets. The expression levels of genes in the sets are aggregated, using what we call a set statistic. The resulting prognostic gene sets were as predictive as the lists of individual genes, but displayed more consistent rankings via bootstrap replications within datasets, produced more stable classifiers across different datasets, and are potentially more interpretable in the biological context since they examine gene expression in the context of their neighbouring genes in the pathway.

Is diagnosing sepsis subjective and highly variable : a survey of intensivists using case vignettes?,"['Sepsis is the focus of national quality improvement programs and a recent public reporting measure from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Does genetic deficiency of complement isoforms C4A or C4B predict improved survival of metastatic renal cell carcinoma?,"['Autoimmune phenomena during immunotherapy are associated with favorable outcomes in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. We have reported improved survival in patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma who carry autoimmunity associated HLA class II haplotypes.

Does cD44-mediated adhesion to hyaluronic acid contribute to mechanosensing and invasive motility?,"['The high-molecular-weight glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronic acid (HA), makes up a significant portion of the brain extracellular matrix. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly invasive brain tumor, is associated with aberrant HA secretion, tissue stiffening, and overexpression of the HA receptor CD44. Here, transcriptomic analysis, engineered materials, and measurements of adhesion, migration, and invasion were used to investigate how HA/CD44 ligation contributes to the mechanosensing and invasive motility of GBM tumor cells, both intrinsically and in the context of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide/integrin adhesion. Analysis of transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas reveals upregulation of transcripts associated with HA/CD44 adhesion. CD44 suppression in culture reduces cell adhesion to HA on short time scales (0.5-hour postincubation) even if RGD is present, whereas maximal adhesion on longer time scales (3 hours) requires both CD44 and integrins. Moreover, time-lapse imaging demonstrates that cell adhesive structures formed during migration on bare HA matrices are more short lived than cellular protrusions formed on surfaces containing RGD. Interestingly, adhesion and migration speed were dependent on HA hydrogel stiffness, implying that CD44-based signaling is intrinsically mechanosensitive. Finally, CD44 expression paired with an HA-rich microenvironment maximized three-dimensional invasion, whereas CD44 suppression or abundant integrin-based adhesion limited it. These findings demonstrate that CD44 transduces HA-based stiffness cues, temporally precedes integrin-based adhesion maturation, and facilitates invasion.']",['UNLABELLED'],"['Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Shape', 'Fibronectins', 'Glioblastoma', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', 'Hyaluronic Acid', 'Hydrogel, Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate', 'Integrins', 'Mechanotransduction, Cellular', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Oligopeptides']",,,,yes,"This study reveals that the CD44 receptor, which is commonly overexpressed in GBM tumors, is critical for cell adhesion, invasion, and mechanosensing of an HA-based matrix.",0,SCIENCE,Simple Datatype-Boolean,"Analytical/Evaluative (Convergent Thinking): This merged category is for queries that involve dissecting complex information or data to understand underlying patterns, reasons, or to make informed judgements.

Does a pepper MSRB2 gene confer drought tolerance in rice through the protection of chloroplast-targeted genes?,"['The perturbation of the steady state of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to biotic and abiotic stresses in a plant could lead to protein denaturation through the modification of amino acid residues, including the oxidation of methionine residues.

Does captopril inhibit glucose accumulation in retinal cells in diabetes?,"['Clinical studies have detected an unexpected inhibition of diabetic retinopathy by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, but the mechanism for this action is unclear. In light of evidence indicating that the severity of hyperglycemia is a major initiating factor in the pathogenesis of the retinopathy, this study was conducted to examine the effect of ACE inhibitors on glucose accumulation in retinas of diabetic rats.', 'Rats were made experimentally diabetic by injection of streptozotocin and treated with captopril (25 mg/kg body weight per day) or atenolol (10 mg/kg body weight per day) for 8 weeks. Bovine retinal endothelial cells were cultured in medium containing either 5.5 or 25 mM glucose and treated with different concentrations of captopril or lisinopril for 5 days. Glucose content in retinas and cultured cells was measured by spectrometry. Expression of glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 in retinas and cultured cells was determined by Western blot analysis. Glucose uptake was performed by using 3-O-methyl-D-[(3)H] glucose.', 'Treatment of rats with captopril inhibited the diabetes-induced accumulation of glucose in the retina by 48% (P < 0.01) compared with the diabetic control, but atenolol had no significant effect.

Does patient Experience show Little Relationship with Hospital Quality Management Strategies?,"['Patient-reported experience measures are increasingly being used to routinely monitor the quality of care.

Is breast-cancer-associated metastasis significantly increased in a model of autoimmune arthritis?,"['Sites of chronic inflammation are often associated with the establishment and growth of various malignancies including breast cancer.

"Is apoptotic cell death a widespread phenomenon in normal aging and osteoarthritis human articular knee cartilage : a study of proliferation , programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) , and viability of chondrocytes in normal and osteoarthritic human knee cartilage?","['Chondrocytes are crucial for adequate matrix balance and function. Cell proliferation and, recently, extensive apoptotic cell death have been reported in osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage. Apoptotic cell death would be an obvious central factor in the initiation and progression of OA, since there is no potential for replacing articular chondrocytes in the adult. Therefore, we studied the occurrence of apoptotic cell disintegration and cell proliferation in OA and normal articular cartilage obtained from the knees of adult donors of all ages.', 'Following immunostaining for cellular proteins as well as staining for nuclear DNA, we performed triple-channel confocal laser scanning microscopy on thick cartilage slices to evaluate lacunar emptying and cell viability. Cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death were evaluated morphologically, by immunodetection of the proliferation-associated Ki-67 antigen, and by the TUNEL reaction.', 'With the exception of the calcified layer, we were not able to detect any major (apoptotic or nonapoptotic) cell disintegration in normal young or aged articular knee cartilage. Single apoptotic cells were detected in OA articular knee cartilage.

Do the prognostic value of clinical factors and cancer stem cell-related markers in gliomas?,"[""Gliomas are the most frequent brain tumours among adults, and it is estimated that gliomas constitute half of the about 1500 new brain tumours diagnosed in Denmark every year. Existing treatment strategies include neurosurgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Therapy selection is based on experiences from clinical trials, with the risk that the results obtained are restricted to highly selected patients only. Moreover, these studies provided only little knowledge of the clinical behaviour of the tumours. For some time, it has been believed that somatic stem cells are responsible for self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation during development of different (normal) tissues. The same characteristics were identified in cancer cells, and recently a major part of the glioma research has focused on the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis, suggesting that only CSCs posses the ability of initiating new tumours. Moreover, CSCs have been suggested as the cause of resistance towards radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In gliomas, CSCs were originally identified by means of the expression of CD133, but other proteins have subsequently been suggested as CSC related. To improve patients' survival, further knowledge about the biological but also about the clinical presentation of gliomas and of glioma patients in an entire population was needed. Identification of patients who would benefit from standard treatment as well as identification of patients who need more aggressive treatment at the time of diagnosis is essential. Equally important is the identification of patients who will not benefit from current standard treatment. Moreover, as common exclusion criteria in clinical trials are age, performance status, and a histologically verified diagnosis, knowledge regarding clinical characteristics in the total population was highly needed. In manuscripts 1 and 2, sampling from national registries was performed and clinical data were collected in order to indentify a clinical prognostic profile for patients with WHO grade I-II tumours (LGG) and WHO grade III-IV tumours (HGG). By using a population-based setup, we identified 433 patients who were diagnosed with a primary glioma in the period 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009, and of these 76 patients were clinically diagnosed and 357 had a histologically verified diagnosis. We found that younger age, a non-astrocytic histology, having performance status (PS) 0-1, and the absence of neurological deficits were associated with a better prognosis in patients with LGGs. In patients with HGGs younger age, having PS 0-1, absence of neurological deficits, having a tumour that does not cross the midline, and receiving curatively intended post-surgical treatment were associated with a superior prognosis. Older patients also benefitted from curatively intended treatment, although their survival was inferior as compared to younger patients receiving similar treatment. In addition, the prognostic value of having somatic mutation affecting the protein isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) was evaluated. Presence of a mutated IDH1 was associated with a better prognosis in patients with WHO grade II and III tumours, whereas no prognostic potential was identified in the group of GBMs. In manuscript 3, the independent prognostic value of the RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 was evaluated using fluorescence-based automated quantitative image acquisition. The prognostic significance was subsequently investigated in relation to the observed clinical prognostic variables. We found that Musashi-1 was not prognostic in WHO grade II tumours, but in WHO grade III high levels of Musashi-1 were associated with poor survival, although the conclusion is based on very few patients. The opposite effect was identified in a sub-group of postsurgical treated GBM patients expressing high levels of Musashi-1 and a superior prognosis. It may be speculated that Musashi-1 status has a predictive value to the effect of chemo radiotherapy in GBM patients, but the study was not designed to explore a potential predictive potential, and this should be investigated in further material. In manuscript 4, a double staining of CD133 and nestin was performed. The use of fluorescence made it possible to identify expression of CD133 and nestin in the same cell, which has never been done before. However, neither co-localisation nor expression of CD133 or nestin was associated with survival.""]",['UNLABELLED'],"['AC133 Antigen', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Glioma', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Nestin', 'Peptides', 'Prognosis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,,yes,"Clinical variables associated with better survival were identified for patients with both LGGs and HGGs.

Is gSK3beta involved in JNK2-mediated beta-catenin inhibition?,"['We have recently reported that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) JNK1 downregulates beta-catenin signaling and plays a critical role in regulating intestinal homeostasis and in suppressing tumor formation. This study was designed to determine whether JNK2, another MAPK, has similar and/or different functions in the regulation of beta-catenin signaling.', 'We used an in vitro system with manipulation of JNK2 and beta-catenin expression and found that activated JNK2 increased GSK3beta activity and inhibited beta-catenin expression and transcriptional activity. However, JNK2-mediated downregulation of beta-catenin was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and GSK3beta inhibitor lithium chloride. Moreover, targeted mutations at GSK3beta phosphorylation sites (Ser33 and Ser37) of beta-catenin abrogated JNK2-mediated suppression of beta-catenin. In vivo studies further revealed that JNK2 deficiency led to upregulation of beta-catenin and increase of GSK3-beta phosphorylation in JNK2-/- mouse intestinal epithelial cells.

Does the nascent polypeptide-associated complex modulate interactions between the signal recognition particle and the ribosome?,"['The first step in the co-translational targeting of secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane involves the recognition of signal sequences by the 54 kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle (SRP) as they emerge from the ribosome. It has recently been proposed that the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) contributes to the fidelity of targeting by modulating interactions that occur between the ribosome-nascent chain complex, the SRP and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Precisely how NAC influences SRP function is presently unclear.', 'We have used immunoblotting experiments to monitor interactions between the SRP and the ribosome-nascent chain complex, in the absence and presence of NAC. In the absence of NAC, SRP binds in a high-salt-resistant manner only to ribosomes that contain a signal sequence, confirming the specificity of SRP for signal sequences. Binding of SRP to signalless ribosome nascent chains is observed at lower salt concentrations; however, the amount of SRP bound to this complex is indistinguishable from that bound to ribosomes lacking nascent chains. Thus, this salt-sensitive binding is likely to be the result of interactions between SRP and the ribosome that occur independently of the nascent chain. A minimal particle consisting of SRP54 and SRP RNA is sufficient to confer salt-resistant binding to ribosomes that contain signal sequences, whereas all of the SRP subunits are required for salt-sensitive binding to ribosomes that lack nascent chains. This salt-sensitive binding by SRP is inhibited by the addition of purified NAC.']","['BACKGROUND', 'RESULTS']","['Peptides', 'Protein Binding', 'Ribosomes', 'Salts', 'Signal Recognition Particle']",,,,yes,"Based on our results, we define two distinct modes of interaction between SRP and the ribosome-nascent chain complex: salt-resistant interactions between SRP54 and signal sequences, and salt-sensitive interactions between additional components of SRP and the ribosome. We conclude that NAC does not directly influence signal sequence recognition by SRP but, rather, that it negatively modulates interactions that occur between SRP and the ribosome itself. These results are discussed in terms of a model wherein SRP and NAC regulate each others' activity during protein targeting.",0,SCIENCE,Simple Datatype-Boolean,"Analytical/Evaluative (Convergent Thinking): This merged category is for queries that involve dissecting complex information or data to understand underlying patterns, reasons, or to make informed judgements.

Does epigallocatechin gallate incorporation into lignin enhance the alkaline delignification and enzymatic saccharification of cell walls?,"['Lignin is an integral component of the plant cell wall matrix but impedes the conversion of biomass into biofuels. The plasticity of lignin biosynthesis should permit the inclusion of new compatible phenolic monomers such as flavonoids into cell wall lignins that are consequently less recalcitrant to biomass processing. In the present study, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was evaluated as a potential lignin bioengineering target for rendering biomass more amenable to processing for biofuel production.', 'In vitro peroxidase-catalyzed polymerization experiments revealed that both gallate and pyrogallyl (B-ring) moieties in EGCG underwent radical cross-coupling with monolignols mainly by β-O-4-type cross-coupling, producing benzodioxane units following rearomatization reactions. Biomimetic lignification of maize cell walls with a 3:1 molar ratio of monolignols and EGCG permitted extensive alkaline delignification of cell walls (72 to 92%) that far exceeded that for lignified controls (44 to 62%). Alkali-insoluble residues from EGCG-lignified walls yielded up to 34% more glucose and total sugars following enzymatic saccharification than lignified controls.']","['BACKGROUND', 'RESULTS']",[],,,,yes,"It was found that EGCG readily copolymerized with monolignols to become integrally cross-coupled into cell wall lignins, where it greatly enhanced alkaline delignification and subsequent enzymatic saccharification. Improved delignification may be attributed to internal trapping of quinone-methide intermediates to prevent benzyl ether cross-linking of lignin to structural polysaccharides during lignification, and to the cleavage of ester intra-unit linkages within EGCG during pretreatment. Overall, our results suggest that apoplastic deposition of EGCG for incorporation into lignin would be a promising plant genetic engineering target for improving the delignification and saccharification of biomass crops.",0,SCIENCE,Simple Datatype-Boolean,"Analytical/Evaluative (Convergent Thinking): This merged category is for queries that involve dissecting complex information or data to understand underlying patterns, reasons, or to make informed judgements.
