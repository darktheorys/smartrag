5731223aa5e9cc1400cdbc6f,Qing_dynasty,"Nurhaci declared himself the ""Bright Khan"" of the Later Jin (lit. ""gold"") state in honor both of the 12–13th century Jurchen Jin dynasty and of his Aisin Gioro clan (Aisin being Manchu for the Chinese 金 (jīn, ""gold"")).  His son Hong Taiji renamed the dynasty Great Qing in 1636. There are competing explanations on the meaning of Qīng (lit. ""clear"" or ""pure""). The name may have been selected in reaction to the name of the Ming dynasty (明), which consists of the Chinese characters for ""sun"" (日) and ""moon"" (月), both associated with the fire element of the Chinese zodiacal system. The character Qīng (清) is composed of ""water"" (氵) and ""azure"" (青), both associated with the water element. This association would justify the Qing conquest as defeat of fire by water. The water imagery of the new name may also have had Buddhist overtones of perspicacity and enlightenment and connections with the Bodhisattva Manjusri. The Manchu name daicing, which sounds like a phonetic rendering of Dà Qīng or Dai Ching, may in fact have been derived from a Mongolian word that means ""warrior"". Daicing gurun may therefore have meant ""warrior state"", a pun that was only intelligible to Manchu and Mongol people. In the later part of the dynasty, however, even the Manchus themselves had forgotten this possible meaning.",What Mongolian word did Qing dynasty get it's name from?,"{'text': ['Mongolian word that means ""warrior""'], 'answer_start': [1045]}"

These include artistic traditions in pottery, music, architecture, wood carving and other genres. Somali art is characterized by its aniconism, partly as a result of the vestigial influence of the pre-Islamic mythology of the Somalis coupled with their ubiquitous Muslim beliefs. However, there have been cases in the past of artistic depictions representing living creatures, such as certain ancient rock paintings in northern Somalia, the golden birds on the Mogadishan canopies, and the plant decorations on religious tombs in southern Somalia.

572850e43acd2414000df8f6,LaserDisc,"Another significant issue unique to LaserDisc is one involving the inconsistency of playback quality between different makers and models of player. On most televisions, a given DVD player will produce a picture that is visually indistinguishable from other units. Differences in image quality between players only becomes easily apparent on large televisions and substantial leaps in image quality are generally only obtained with expensive, high-end players that allow for post-processing of the MPEG-2 stream during playback. In contrast, LaserDisc playback quality is highly dependent on hardware quality. Major variances in picture quality appear between different makers and models of LD players, even when tested on a low to mid-range television. The obvious benefits of using high quality equipment has helped keep demand for some players high, thus also keeping pricing for those units comparably high. In the 1990s, notable players sold for anywhere from US$200 to well over $1,000, while older and less desirable players could be purchased in working condition for as little as $25.",What range of prices were high-end LaserDisc players in the 1990s?,"{'text': ['US$200 to well over $1,000'], 'answer_start': [964]}"

In 1512 an Act of Parliament was passed for further fortifying Plymouth, and a series of fortifications were then built, including defensive walls at the entrance to Sutton Pool (across which a chain would be extended in time of danger). Defences on St Nicholas Island also date from this time, and a string of six artillery blockhouses were built, including one on Fishers Nose at the south-eastern corner of the Hoe. This location was further strengthened by the building of a fort (later known as Drake's Fort) in 1596, which itself went on to provide the site for the Citadel, established in the 1660s (see below).","Before Plymouth dockyard was built, where was the fleet located?","{'text': ['Sutton Pool'], 'answer_start': [408]}"

Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. While uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons.

For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the ""subject"" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed ""object"" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of ""subject-object identity,"" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural ""God"") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality—and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's ""self-realization"" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every ""object"" it observes is something ""alien,"" meaning something separate or apart from ""subject."" In Hegel's words, ""The object is revealed to it [to ""subject""] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself."" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every ""object"" is himself, because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the ""finite"" (man, human) becomes the ""infinite"" (""God,"" divine), replacing the imaginary or ""picture-thinking"" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: ""Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'""

570a7c686d058f1900182e99,Beer,"A study published in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.",What year did the Neuropsychopharmacology journal publist a study about the effect on the brain of beers flavor?,"{'text': ['2013'], 'answer_start': [60]}"

Vacuum does not mean that the curvature of space-time is necessarily flat: the gravitational field can still produce curvature in a vacuum in the form of tidal forces and gravitational waves (technically, these phenomena are the components of the Weyl tensor). The black hole (with zero electric charge) is an elegant example of a region completely ""filled"" with vacuum, but still showing a strong curvature.",What has no electric charge?,"{'text': ['black hole'], 'answer_start': [421]}"
56f8bb479b226e1400dd0ec6,Gene,"The nucleotide sequence of a gene's DNA specifies the amino acid sequence of a protein through the genetic code. Sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, each correspond to a specific amino acid.:6 Additionally, a ""start codon"", and three ""stop codons"" indicate the beginning and end of the protein coding region. There are 64 possible codons (four possible nucleotides at each of three positions, hence 43 possible codons) and only 20 standard amino acids; hence the code is redundant and multiple codons can specify the same amino acid. The correspondence between codons and amino acids is nearly universal among all known living organisms.",What are sets of three nucleotides known as?,"{'text': ['codons'], 'answer_start': [149]}"
